- The main board is built out of eight sectors laid out as an octagonal shape. Shuffle these parts and join them according their borders and pins.

- All emotiles will be put into the provided bag and shuffled. 
- Fill up the blank emotile spaces between the axes by drawing them from the bag  (side won't matter). Colour of the middle stripe shouldn't match with adjacent tiles within a sector. Replace any such matching tiles with different ones from the bag.
- Distribute one emotile from the bag to each player as their beginning tiles. These will be queued in front of them, visible and accessible by other players.
- Leave the remaining emotiles within the bag for further usage.
- Separate and shuffle the parents deck as two piles by gender. Deal out a father and a mother persona card for each and stashing the rest back into the box. They won't be used within this game.
- Shuffle the partners deck and lay out 5 partners in a row.
- Shuffle the pattern tiles and create a down-facing pile. Each player draws two from these as inherited patterns. These are laid out openly in front of the player.
- Shuffle the event cards and deal each 6 cards.
- Fill the shoshin-track of each player with 16 wooden disc markers.
