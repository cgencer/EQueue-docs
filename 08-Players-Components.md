## Players Components

##### The Crystals
*Currency of Attention, Awareness and Mindfulness*

Colored crystals act as our attention / awareness, tinted with our personal color. Throughout the game players actions and choices require attention / awareness, which they play with the colored crystals.  

During the game they cultivate unbiased and attachment-free mindfulness, represented by the colorless crystals of our untainted and pure mind. 

##### *Shoshin Track*

Shoshin is a Zen-term describing a mindset of having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions just as a beginner would. Letting our past experiences, expectations and learned behaviours defining our actions lowers the genuinity and quality of the moment, which results against the shoshin mindset.

Whenever a player plays a card and picks up emotions, they build a motivation, either as desire or aversion. This biased motivation acts as a hindrance against our flexibility and freedom. By default, we have a clean slate, which becomes occupied by the markers we move from the shoshin-track onto the axes. Later in the game, to go back to our shoshin mind-set requires the markers removed back from axes onto the shoshin-track. 

The first level on each axis is the acceptable minimum and any marker more counts against our pure mind, which will be deducted on the scoring phase.

##### *Tranquility Track*

Experiencing various actions and emotions alter our peace by creating stress, desire or aversion. Some actions require a peaceful mindset and the players goal is to cultivate tranquility. Stress and tranquility is oppositely is counted with a track for each player.
