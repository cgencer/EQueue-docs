## Players Components
##### The Crystals, Currency of Attention, Awareness and Mindfulness

Colored crystals act as our attention / awareness, tinted with our personality color. Throughout the game our actions and choices require our attention or awareness applied to a given situation, which lowers our overall awareness. 

During the game the player aims to cultivate mindfulness, unbiased and attachment-free represented by the colorless crystals, our untainted and pure mindfulness. 
##### *Shoshin State & Equilibrium*

Shoshin is a Zen-term describing a mindset of having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions just as a beginner would. 

The more we know about a subject, the more likely we depend on our memories of it and stop accepting any further experiences.
Acting with predetermined motivations and playing within a known set of emotions raises or expectancies and motivations, decreasing our shoshin-state. But cultivating mindfulness enables us to lower these expectations and decrease the accounted motivations. The first level on each axis is the acceptable minimum, any markers above that decreases our shoshin-track.
##### *Stress & Tranquility Track*
