## Parents

### Setup and the Dominant Parent

After the player is dealt with their parents cards, they decide which of the parents acts as the dominant person depending on the issues icon (on the top right corner):
- if both parents do not have the issues icon, player choses one of the parents to alter the setup of the axes and puts the number of markers onto the axes as shown.
- The parent with the issues icon will be the dominant person within the family, the secondary parent will be tucked below the dominant as shown.

Until the issue with dominant parent has been dealt with,  their parameters will be used primarily. The secondary parent only contributes with another set of emotional pattern the player could be triggered with.

On the end of the round the dominant parent stays until their issue gets resolved. Both the secondary parents emotional experiences and upcoming partners extra action, especially their values also will be shadowed by the dominant parents 'needs', until solved. 
### Parents and Matching with a Partner

As long as the dominant parents issue is present, any matched partners will go below the family, only providing with another pattern. Their experienced emotions (for the set collection) and the card value won't be counted, and extra actions won't be available to use. Only when the dominant parents issue has been solved, all members of the family will be counted separately.

### Resolving the Emotional Issue

The dominant parent has a special need, an emotional issue that the player needs to resolve first in order to able to benefit from all aspects of the personas within their family.
