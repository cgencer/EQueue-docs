**Persona Cards**
The cards with the yellowish frame are parent personas while the grey-bordered cards are partner personas. The parents do not have interests, but some of them come with traumatic issues. The partner personas have all interest icons to match with.
Each persona brings an emotional pattern. Whenever a persona is added to our intimate circle, an additional pattern tile should be drawn from the pile.
