==Praise and blame, success and failure, 
pleasure and pain, and fame and disrepute;==
==these are the eight worldly conditions that revolve around the world and==
==the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.==

The axes act as a source for emotions, four dualistic, mundane concerns that generally motivate our actions. These common denominators or major tendencies are the so-called *eight earthly concerns*, throwing us out-of-balance by triggering emotions.
- hope for pleasure / happiness & fear of pain / suffering,
- hope for gain & fear of loss,
- hope for praise & fear of blame,
- hope for good reputation / fame & fear of bad reputation / shame.
These are our innermost strategies to strive and survive. With some more insight, we could relate all of our emotions, decisions and actions to these motivations.  Preoccupation with these worldly concerns is said to be an important obstacle on our path.

- The motivations can be either the reason or result of emotions or events.
- Emotions can either be the reasons to or results of events.
- Events we experience within life can either be the reasons to or results.
## The Middle Path

We become dissatisfied of any situation because we always want just a bit more than the last time. We will have stronger needs and requirements each and every time we use these tendencies. Because of this raised expectations, we feel things stronger but we also won't get satisfied.

Playing the event-cards pushes our motivations on the eight axes to a higher level -outwards- bringing us further away from the middle. These raising expectations are the result of our previous events, the discs from the shoshin-track move to the axes marking their usage.

As we progress, we discover that giving way to more and more is not a solution for finding happiness. We should cut down our expectations in order to get satisfaction. To do this, we have to unbuild these motivators and raise our shoshin-level hopefully back to its initial state, at least to its minimal level.
## Attachments

Emotions mostly require either an event or a persons participation. After surfacing, they have a short life-span, unless they are results of our thoughts or motivations. 

Causality tells us that everything has a reason, a source to exist. A tree springs from a seed, a waterfall requires a river of water, living beings have their parents as their source. Actions and emotions both have motivations -underlying strategies of our ego- as their source and vice versa . Our ego normalises these and serves us only bite-size portions. As much as experiencing the emotions is an important factor so is becoming aware of them, observing their connections and the underlying motivations the basics to understand, build compassion and live a harmonious life.

Social sciences help us understand emotions, their causes, effects and results by analysing and classifying them. Buddhism has a deep insight of our mind and its inner working collected from deep observations, how they become and evolve, how they lead us. Daoism has some methods which can help us handling them in a peaceful way.

Our mind understands through opposites and references. One side of an opposite always attract us more, we choose this over that. Under the hood our mind classifies everything as pleasant, neutral and  unpleasant. We always have a bias towards pleasing and prefer to leave neutral and unpleasant aside.

In its very core, buddhism shows us how to practice The Middle Path: if you observe a musician tuning the strings of his instrument, you'll see that the to loose or tense adjustment of the strings results with bad sounds. A better solution would be *The Middle Path* where only the required amount of tension / relaxing is applied. Same can be applied to our inner motivations for balancing life. Only use the necessary amount of them, nor less and not more.

When practicing sports or music, repetitive practice trains our muscles to respond 
Repeating emotional sequences become our *patterns*, sometimes even directing our behaviours because repetitive responses lead to having lesser awareness of the situation. Applying mindfulness trough observation brings understanding and dissolving patterns of emotions. This brings us closer to the mindful state within Zen 'Beginners Mind (*Shoshin*). Shoshin removes preconceptions and biases from our mind. The curiosity and joy of shoshin, the practice of the middle way and resolving our patterns can lead us to a harmonious life.
## Narrative Tiles
^024396

Family ties bring many emotional interactions and we tend to memorize these and their responses. These are a set of emotional sequences we learn while we grow up. 
We also develop tendencies or biases according to these responses. These tendencies create motivations, our strategies of survival within life.

As partners tend to repeat and/or add to our parents inheritances, partner tiles have less features. 
#### Patterns

Patterns are automated emotional interactions, which means that their outcome is loosing some awareness. They trigger some behaviours in return, sometimes a planned response (in material or other form) from the persona.
#### Emotional Narratives

Both the major and regular emotions show us the experienced emotions in relation with each persona. We are familiar and comfortable with the experienced ones and shy away from the rest. Experiencing different emotions helps us to deal with them easier. The combined 'emotional knowledge' on all personas emotional narratives show us our experienced emotions, whereas we could see the rest which we still need to learn from. 
#### Shoshin
^d822f1

The more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further learning. As the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki put it in his book _Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind_ (1970): ‘In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.’ Even _feeling_ like an expert also breeds closed-mindedness. To combat confirmation bias, be aware of it. Constantly remind yourself that it exists, and take active steps to work against it by seeking out information and perspectives that contradict your current position. In the 'shoshin' state of mind, you are:
- **Free of preconceptions** of how you should approach change or growth
- **Free of expectations** about what _should_ and _must_ happen
- **Having genuine curiosity** to understand things more deeply
- **Open to a world of possibilities** to discover new approaches, ideas and ways things done from a fresh mindset.
Start noticing your judgements more — when you jump to conclusions about anything, remind yourself to question them.
Allow yourself to want to understand anew.
Approach the world with a sense of authentic curiosity. Begin to see things with an eagerness to understand.
Let go of limiting beliefs and let go of expertise.
To incorporate a beginner’s mindset, Benjamin, Mark and Vincent [recommend](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/leadership/beginners-mindset-decision-making-for-leadership.html) that we consider these four possibilities:

1. _What if my assumptions are wrong, despite the best evidence at hand?_
2. _What if what seem to be perfect solutions drawn from history are no longer relevant?_
3. _What if I could wish for anything I wanted?_
4. _What if my critics are right?_

##### Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

Experiencing and learning to deal with a variety of emotions builds up our emotional intelligence.
