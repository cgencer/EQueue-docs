## End of Game

The goal of the game is to raise our awareness about the emotions. Finding out their hidden behaviours, dismantling triggering emotions while experiencing as much of various emotions to cultivate mindfulness and emotional intelligence are the goals within the game. Each player will use these ways to gather as much clear crystals as possible.

After five rounds of various numbered turns, the game ends. The earned clear crystals are counted as below.
## Scoring and Winning

At the end of five rounds, the player with the most purity crystals becomes the winner; in case of a tie, the tranquility track, then the shorter queue length determine the winner.

Throughout the game, they earn or loose crystals by:
- +1 crystal on each card played by their event,
- +1 crystal on each recognised emotion within a completed set (emotions from the personas contributing to a set shouldn't be counted),
- -3 crystals when a pattern is triggered
At the game end, these alter the count of crystals:
- +value of the persona cards (both in-play and retired) solved (unresolved issues result with other family members to be unaccounted)
- -number of markers used on the axes (except the first level)
