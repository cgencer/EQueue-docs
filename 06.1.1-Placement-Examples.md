1. Because of none continuity of the stripes, placement of the second tile is NOT allowed.
2. There is no middle-stage for the orange, it is NOT allowed to place the second tile.
3. Second tile shouldn't be placed, as there is no continuity between the two. As there are no continuities, second tile is NOT allowed, so is the next one also disqualified.
4. Both the yellow and blue colors work, but no seed-stage for yellow was present. The tiles were allowed to place but the queue is without any fulfilled checkmarks. 
5. The yellow checkmark is well established with its three stages.
6. Two checkmarks have been completed: yellow (at the first tiles) and red (last three tiles). The green progression on 4th & 5th tiles were okay, as they exist as a side-result of the yellow checkmark.
7. Red and yellow checkmarks at the right side have been completed and a progressing blue exists on the last tiles. Only the two completed checkmarks are considered as fulfilled.
