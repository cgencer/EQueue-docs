## End of Game

The goal of the game is to raise our mindfulness by: 
- reach a state called shoshin,
- reach equilibrium trough exercising the middle path; on emotions and experiences, 
- dismantle our patterns, which shadow our shoshin-state.

## Scoring and Winning

At the end of the game when all decks and crystals are exhausted, the player with the most purity crystals becomes the winner; in case of a tie, the crystals remaining in the present basket are counted, then again in the future basket are counted.
