## Emotion Tiles, a.ka Emotiles

The emotiles are double-sided five-coloured tiles with stripes which are attached to the end of other players queues. They are gathered from the octagonal board, The Eight Earthly Concerns. The meaning colours represented are

***A Single Emotile:** the dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellow and in the center light green.*

The colours represent the basic emotional groups (anger, disgust, interest, joy, sadness, surprise, fear, trust). The specific emotions have no importance within this game. But [Robert Plutchik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik "en:Robert Plutchik")'s [Wheel of Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_classification#Plutchik's_wheel_of_emotions "en:Emotion classification" is an overview of most well-known emotions and their colors ()) is a good reference for classificaton and colour representation of the emotions.

When tiles are attached one-by-one, consecutive placement of colours builds an emotion. A dormant emotion gets nurtured with continuity and becomes into existence. The rising emotion, from outermost level *(seed)* to the second-level *(evolving)* and lastly to the centeral third-level  *(becoming)*, forms a checkmark facing either left or right.

***Fulfilled emotion:** The first emotile, the dormant colour of yellow *(seed)* moves into the second level *(evolving)* on the next tile and on the next emotile, it comes into existence *(becoming)*. The red on the 1st and 2nd tiles don't have a seed emotion. With the next emotile, a blue in the middle could fulfil another emotion.*

Whilst on the first- and second-level it is possible to spend some awareness for observing *(dismantling a pattern)* it. On the last level, on becoming, it is already risen and can't be undone. Placement of the emotiles should follow the continuity of colours and tiles with no continuity shouldn't be placed.

#### Picking and using an emotile:
- 1. the axis should match with the event-card to be played.
- 2. the marker-space connecting to the emotile trough lines has to be free of players marker-discs.
- 3. the picked emotile can be used in one of three ways:
	- 1. you can RESERVE the tile, saving for a future turn. Just pick it up and hide it in your stash so other players won't see it.
	- 2. playing its top-side, before the event-card is played

> 		- 3. to play its hidden bottom-side, after the event-card

## Pattern Tiles

When we could observe all our emotions moment by moment within our daily lives, we would see that we experience some recurring sequences. These differ for each person. They are learned behaviours and reflexive responses, mostly rooting back to our family environment, childhood events as well as our daily lives. To master any sports or performing music, we would exercising repetitive actions until they become reflexes. This also happens for emotions, when we practice them regularly they become autonomous responses, resulting with some degree of loss on awareness each time. Because of this process of learning they decrease our shoshin-state.

Every player can have one or more pattern-tiles, showing a sequence of emotions, a pattern. These are inherited and learned sequence of emotions stemming from our closed social circle: the family we grow in and later our relationships. Fulfilling these patterns has the advantage of varied abilities but with the cost of loosing mindfulness.
