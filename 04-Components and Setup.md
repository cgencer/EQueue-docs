- All emotiles will all be put into the bag and drawn from it. 
- Fill up the blank emotile spaces between the axes by drawing them from the bag and using any side of each. The middle colour should be different with their neighbours, vertically (level-) and horizontally (sector-wise). Replace any matching emotiles with new ones from the bag.
- Place an emotile in front of each player as their beginning tiles.
- Leave the remaining emotiles mixes within the bag for further filling out emptied spaces.
- Separate and shuffle the parents deck as two piles by gender. Deal out one father and one mother persona card for each player and remove the rest, stashing them back into the box. 
- Shuffle the partners deck as two piles by gender and lay out 5 partners in a row.
- Shuffle the 32 tiles with colour-sequences and create a down-facing tile. Each player draws two of these as his family relationship patterns and can obtain more within the game. These are laid out openly in front of the player.
- Shuffle the event cards and deal each player 6 cards.
- Fill the shoshin-track for each player with their 16 wooden disc markers.
