## Personas, Parents and Partners 
^d71eb6

Our life starts with our caregivers. We learn our first manners and interaction trough them. They also initiate and imprint our emotional blueprint, provide us with space and tools to develop our emotional background and tendencies.

We start with two caregiver personas as our parents. Throughout the game we are able to build relationships with other personas effecting our emotional sphere.

Personas bring in different behaviours; as each person has its own character, some of the caregivers come with their *traumatic issues*. Personas also have tendencies towards expressing various emotions, sometimes also have a *major emotion* they deal with. 
#### Parents

The cards with the yellowish frame are parent personas while the grey-bordered cards are partner personas. The parents do not have interests, but some of them come with traumatic issues. The partner personas have all interest icons to match with.
Each persona brings an emotional pattern. Whenever a persona is added to our intimate circle, an additional pattern tile should be drawn from the pile.

#### Partners
![[partners.png]]
*The female partner has music, writi
ng, theatre and travelling as their interests and the male partner has biking, writing, music and theatre as interests. These two have 3 matching interests, which makes them more than interesting to each other. Both have green as their major emotion (refer to [[06-Tiles^]]).* 
#### Major and Minor Emotions (a.k.a. Emotional Memory)

Both the major and regular emotions show the experienced emotions in relation with each persona. The combined 'emotional memory' of all interacted active personas show us our collective emotions.
