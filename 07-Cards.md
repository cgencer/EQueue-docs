**Persona Cards**

#### Personas, Family and Coupling

Our life starts with our caregivers. We learn our first manners and interaction trough them. They also initiate and imprint our emotional blueprint, provide us with space and tools to develop our emotional background and tendencies.

We start with two caregiver personas as our parents. Throughout the game we are able to build relationships with other personas effecting our emotional sphere.

Personas bring in different behaviours; as each person has its own character, some of the caregivers come with their *traumatic issues*. Personas also have tendencies towards expressing various emotions, sometimes also have a *major emotion* they deal with. 

The cards with the yellowish frame are parent personas while the grey-bordered cards are partner personas. The parents do not have interests, but some of them come with traumatic issues. The partner personas have all interest icons to match with.
Each persona brings an emotional pattern. Whenever a persona is added to our intimate circle, an additional pattern tile should be drawn from the pile.

*The father figure has gambling as traumatic issues. The mother figure has orange as major emotion.* 
![[partners.png]]
*The female partner has music, writing, theatre and travelling as their interests and the male partner has biking, writing, music and theatre as interests. These two have 3 matching interests, which makes them more than interesting to each other. Both have green as their major emotion.*
