## Setup of the Game

- The main board consists of eight sections laid out in a circular order. Use the sides reflecting the player count. Shuffle its parts and join them to fit their sides borders. Place the axis names facing each other in opposites: happiness / suffering, gain / loss, fame / shame and praise / blame. The order of their placement is unimportant.

- All emotiles will be put into the provided bag and shuffled. 

- Fill up the blank spaces on each section by drawing them from the bag (any side). The color of the middle stripe shouldn't match with any adjacent tiles on levels and octants. Replace any matching tiles with different ones from the bag.

- Distribute an emotile from the bag to each player as beginning tiles. The queue of emotiles will be built in front of each, visible and accessible to other players.

- Leave the remaining emotiles within the bag aside for further usage.

- Separate parents and partners into two decks:
	- Separate the parents deck into piles by gender and shuffle both. Deal out two of each gender from parents persona cards. The player will choose which two of these will represent his family. Put the rest away; they won't be used within this game. 
	- Shuffle the partners deck and draw one card for each player, representing their character. Then lay out 5 partners in a row, leaving the rest as a down-facing stack nearby. 

- Fill the shoshin-tracks with the wooden disc markers. According to the dominant parents values, players put some markers on the specified axes reflecting the inherited motivations.

- Each player puts a marker onto the centre of their stress/ tranquility track.

- Shuffle the event cards and deal each player 6 one-by-one.

- Put the clear crystals within a container to the center of the board, accessible to all.
