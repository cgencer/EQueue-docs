- The main board consists of eight sectors laid out in an octagonal shape. Shuffle the parts and join them according their borders and pins. Place axis names facing each other in opposites: happiness / suffering, gain / loss, fame / shame and praise / blame. The order of their placement does not matter.

- All emotiles will be put into the provided bag and shuffled. 

- Fill up the blank emotile spaces between the axes by drawing them from the bag (any side). Colour of the middle stripe shouldn't match with any adjacent tiles different levels and adjacent sectors. Replace any such matching tiles with different ones from the bag.

- Distribute one emotile from the bag to each player as their beginning tiles. These will be queued in front of them, visible and accessible by other players.

- Leave the remaining emotiles within the bag for further usage.

- Separate the parents deck into two piles by gender and shuffle these. Deal out two parent persona cards (as father and mother) and stash the rest back into the box; they won't be used within this game.

- Shuffle the partners deck and lay out 5 partners in a row.

- Shuffle the pattern tiles and create a down-facing pile. Each player draws two from these as inherited patterns. These are laid out openly in front of the player.

- Shuffle the event cards and deal each 6 cards.

- Fill the shoshin-track of each player with 16 wooden disc markers.
