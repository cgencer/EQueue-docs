## End of Game

The goal of the game is to cultivate a pure mindfulness by: 
- reach back the shoshin state by having enough discs on the track,
- reach equilibrium by exercising the middle path,
- dismantle patterns, which shadow our shoshin-state.
## Scoring and Winning

At the end of five rounds the player with the most purity crystals becomes the winner; in case of a tie, the crystals remaining in the present basket are counted, then again in the future basket are counted.
