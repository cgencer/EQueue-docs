## Five Phases and Its Relation to Emotions

Chinese culture -especially daoism- has a long history of observing nature and human as its part. They have reflected the changes of the seasons onto subjects to learn its true nature which they call it Elemantal Phases or WuXing, Five Element Theory. The word elemental has nothing to do with its physical aspect, it only is described the phases' nature. This elemental wheel has two methods investigating the relation of phases; a feeding phase and a dominating phase.
We can see the relationships each emotion to others has, when we project emotions onto this wheel of phases.

Elements are a circular pattern of phases or states. Each element has a feeding and destroying cycle, in which it is in contact with the other four elements. By knowing the nature of an event, one can follow its phases and also use these for transforming phases to their advantages.
By the feeding cycle, we can convert an action to result with an emotion, the action raises the emotion. By the destroying cycle, we suppress an emotion by some action. 
Both the feeding and destroying cycle exist bi-directional; e.g. every element has a feeding / fed by element, and a dominating / dominated by element where the direction determines its target, us or others.
