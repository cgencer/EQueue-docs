## Emotion Tiles, a.k.a. Emotiles
^b91eec
*emotional queue, continuity of emotions, fulfilling emotions*

The emotiles are tiles each with five colored stripes. They are picked up from the main board and either attached to the end of a queue or held on reserve. The tiles are two-sided, same colored with one side symbols to distinguish stripes for color-blindness.

Even though they bear no importance within the game, the colors represent the basic emotional groups anger, disgust, interest, joy, sadness, surprise, fear and trust. You can find more info on this grouping at [[13.1-The-Colors-of-Emotions|Appendix 13.1, The Colors of Emotions]].

When tiles are attached to a queue, strategic placement of the tiles creates a continuity of a color throughout a few tiles. Three of these stripes build a visual checkmark. This represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion *(seed)* gets nurtured and grows into existence *(evolving)*. Lastly by adding the third stage *(becoming)*, it becomes the checkmark, its side bears no meaning. 

Whilst on the first- and second-level the tiles have to be attached by other players.. On the last level, it is already risen and therefor need to be recognised by the owner of the queue before others do. If we observe and recognise the risen emotion by completing its last stage we can earn an awareness crystal (from our storage) for practicing mindfulness.

Placement of the emotiles should carry the continuity of colors further and tiles without continuity shouldn't be placed. Each new tile is to be placed where the arrow points to, at the queue's end.

**A fulfilled emotion:** The first emotile, the dormant color of yellow *(seed)* moves into the second level *(evolving)* on the next tile and it comes into existence *(becoming)* on the third. The red on the 1st and 2nd tiles don't have a seed emotion. With the next emotile, a blue in the middle could fulfil another emotion.

## Placement Examples

![[placements.png]]
1. Because of none continuity of the stripes, placement of the second tile is NOT allowed.
2. There is no middle-stage for the orange, it is NOT allowed to place the second tile.
3. Second tile shouldn't be placed, as there is no continuity between the two. As there are no continuities, second tile is NOT allowed, so is the next one also disqualified.
4. Both the yellow and blue colors work, but no seed-stage for yellow was present. The tiles were allowed to place but the queue is without any fulfilled checkmarks. 
5. The yellow checkmark is well established with its three stages.
6. Two checkmarks have been completed: yellow (at the first tiles) and red (last three tiles). The green progression on 4th & 5th tiles were okay, as they exist as a side-result of the yellow checkmark.
7. Red and yellow checkmarks at the right side have been completed and a progressing blue exists on the last tiles. Only the two completed checkmarks are considered as fulfilled.
