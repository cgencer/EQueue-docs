## Emotion Tiles, a.k.a. Emotiles
*emotional queue, continuity of emotions, fulfilling emotions*

The emotiles are two-sided tiles of five colored stripes. They are distributed onto the game board and picked up to apply to a queue. Once they are put onto the board, their side remains the same throughout the game.

***A Single Emotile:** The dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellowÂ and in the center light green.*

Even though it bears no importance within the game, the colors represent the basic emotional groups anger, disgust, interest, joy, sadness, surprise, fear and trust. You can find a reference chart and more info on these in the Appendix sections.

Planned placement of the tiles creates a color continuity spanning over three tiles, forming a visual checkmark sign. Its steps represent the growing of an emotion: a *seed*ed emotion gets nurtured and *evolve*s into existence. Lastly by adding the third stage *(becoming)*, it becomes a checkmark either facing left or right. 

The first two tiles are attached by the other players. As they initiate emotions on us, an emotion is arises which needs to be recognised by the owner of the queue. Taking ownership by recognising and handling this emotion wisely earns the player a crystal for being mindful of the emotions. If other players act first to complete this arisen emotion on our queue, we loose a crystal. Recognising and handling of emotions is done either by applying an emotile acquired or raising emotions by converting actions.
##### *Development Stages and Emotional Continuity*

By attaching tiles consecutively the stripes form a visible checkmark throughout the tiles. It represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion from outermost stripe as first stage *(seed)* to its second stage *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third stage *(completion)* fulfills the emotion, facing either left or right (towards us or other, which bears no importance).

Placement of the emotiles should carry the continuity of colors further and tiles without continuity shouldn't be placed. Each new tile is to be placed at the queue's end. Completion has precedence when various stages of stripes are present on the same queue.

**A fulfilled emotion:** The first emotile, the dormant color of yellow *(seed)* moves into the second level *(evolving)* on the next tile and it comes into existence *(becoming)* on the third. The red on the 1st and 2nd tiles don't have a seed emotion. With the next emotile, a blue in the middle could fulfil another emotion but a green tile in the middle could be disrupting the flow.

##### Picking Up Emotiles

To pick new emotiles, players have to play cards for events or use their actions. Players may pick up an emotile from the locations connected to the cards matched axis. Some bonus actions on various cards enable to expand the possibilities, which are also described in detail on the card information pages. Following procedures apply to pick up an emotile:
	- a) The marker-space of one of the two the adjacent axes of a matching card isn't occupied by the player,
	- b) Its capacity hasn't been filled,
	- c) The shoshin-track of the player should have disc-markers to take from.
	- d) **(If the tile is to be played directly)** the tile has to match at least one queue by continuity.
		**(else, to reserve a tile)** An unmatching tile could still be taken **unless no reserved tile** for the player exists. 
	- e) The player should have enough crystals (of his color) to activate the matching card.
	- f) Order of card activation and tile placement do not matter.
