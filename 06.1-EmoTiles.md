## Emotion Tiles, a.k.a. Emotiles

*emotional queue, continuity of emotions, fulfilling emotions*

The emotiles are tiles each with five colored stripes. They are placed onto the game board at the begin and picked up from the main board to be applied to the end of a queue (or held one on reserve). Once they are put onto the board, their side remains the same throughout the game.

Even though it bears no importance within the game, the colors represent the basic emotional groups anger, disgust, interest, joy, sadness, surprise, fear and trust. You can find a reference chart and more info on this in [[13.B-The-Colors-of-Emotions|Appendix 13.1, The Colors of Emotions]].

Planned placement of these tiles creates a color continuity spanning over three tiles, forming a visual checkmark sign. Its steps represent the growing of an emotion: a *seed*ed emotion gets nurtured and *evolve*s into existence. Lastly by adding the third stage *(becoming)*, it becomes a checkmark either facing left or right. 

The first two tiles have to be attached by other players. On the last level, as the emotion is arisen and needs to be recognised by the player -the owner of the queue- before others complete it. Taking ownership, recognising and handling this emotion wisely earns the player an additional crystal for being mindful of the emotions.

Placement of the emotiles should carry the continuity of colors further and tiles without continuity shouldn't be placed. Each new tile is to be placed at the queue's end. When both a second level on a side and completion of three levels on another side exists, completion always has precedence.

**A fulfilled emotion:** The first emotile, the dormant color of yellow *(seed)* moves into the second level *(evolving)* on the next tile and it comes into existence *(becoming)* on the third. The red on the 1st and 2nd tiles don't have a seed emotion. With the next emotile, a blue in the middle could fulfil another emotion but a green tile in the middle can be a disruptor.
