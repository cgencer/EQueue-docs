Emotions alter our expectancies, motivating us towards new experiences. Players pick up and build up emotions onto queues, sometime triggering patterns and activating events which lead to new emotions. Experiencing events lead to new emotions, preferably to new ones. Dealing and taking care of your emotions needs to be practiced wisely and among family, friends and our partners, we also should give attention to what we may trigger upon them as well.

With the included optional expansion, players also might able to dismantle emotions to discover and understand the layered-nature of them.

## The Objective
^0f9129

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or cards in their hand. Players compete with each other by attaching emotiles to the end of others queue by continuing the colored stripes of a previous tile. Payment is done with the crystals in their color, symbolizing attention / awareness. By the choices, actions and the emotion tiles, players collect clear (colorless) crystals throughout the game. Tracks for several states of the mind exist which acts as some hindrances. By the end of fifth round, the player who has the most clear crystals wins.

Various methods exist where we spend/earn crystals and/or collect clear crystals:
- being in a state called *[[13.A-Appendix#^d822f1|shoshin]]* and equilibrium by exercising *[[13.A-Appendix#^dcd6f9|the middle path]]*
- build *[[#Emotional Continuity|emotional continuity]]* by *[[#Recognising Emotions|recognising emotions]]*.
- collecting sets of experienced emotions and self-completed emotions.
- dissolving own *triggering patterns*
- and optionally investigating and *dismantling layered emotions*.
##### The Crystals, Currency of Attention, Awareness and Mindfulness

Colored crystals act as our attention / awareness, tinted with our personality color. Throughout the game our actions and choices require our attention or awareness applied to a given situation, which lowers our overall awareness. 
During the game we should strive to cultivate mindfulness, unbiased and attachment-free represented by the colorless crystals accumulating our untainted and pure mindfulness. 
##### *Shoshin State & Equilibrium*

Shoshin is a Zen-term describing a mindset describing the beginners mind and eagerness and joy of learning anew. The more we know about a subject, the more likely we depend on our memories of it and stop accepting any further experiences.
Acting with predetermined motivations and playing within a known set of emotions raises or expectancies and motivations, decreasing our shoshin-state. But cultivating mindfulness enables us to lower these expectations and decrease the accounted motivations. The first level on each axis is the acceptable minimum, any markers above that decreases our shoshin-track.
##### *Emotional Continuity*

*Please refer to [[06-Tiles#^666a75|Emotiles]] for a detailed information.*

***A Single Emotile:** The dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellowÂ and in the center light green.*

By attaching tiles consecutively the stripes form a visible checkmark throughout the tiles. It represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion from outermost stripe as first stage *(seed)* to its second stage *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third stage *(completion)* fulfills the emotion, facing either left or right (towards us or other, which bears no importance).
##### Picking Up Emotiles

To pick new emotiles, players have to play various events or actions. Players may pick up an emotile from the locations connected to the cards matched axis. Some bonus actions on various cards enable to expand the possibilities, which are also described in detail on the card information pages. Following procedures apply to pick up an emotile:
	- a) The marker-space of one of the two the adjacent axes with a matching card in-hand still has a space for the disc-marker.
	- b) The space shouldn't be already occupied by the player.
	- c) The shoshin-track of the player should have disc-markers to take from.
	- d) **(If the tile is to be played directly)** the tile has to match a queue.
		**(else, to reserve a tile)** An unmatching tile could be still taken **unless no reserved tile** for the player exists. Refer to [[09-Special-Actions#^dd5bad|Special Actions: Reserving EmoTiles]].
	- e) The player should have enough crystals (of his color) to activate the matching card.
	- f) Order of card activation and tile placement do not matter.
##### Recognising: Regulating and Suppressing of Emotions
*take-that interplay of emotions*

As in life, the rising of an emotion is an interaction between different players. Players initiate and foster emotions onto others (queues) and recognise, regulate or suppress emotions on their own queues.

Recognising fosters Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and raises our mindfulness. As well as it is used on own emotions by, respecting others emotions is also helps grow our EQ. 

Players seed and foster emotions onto others queues with they need to be aware of own arising emotions and handle them wisely, not impulsively. 

Recognising is done by completion of own arisen emotions, either completing it with a fitting emotile or regulating / suppressing them based on their elemental phases. If the player is handle the arisen emotion, they earn crystals for their attention and awareness. If others beat the player by acting first, the player loses a crystal. The successfully recognised emotion covering the last three emotiles is removed from our queue, the last of the three saved separately to form a collection of our *[[#Emotional Intelligence (EQ)]]*.
##### *Priority of Emotiles*

Completion of an emotion has priority over rising emotions. Within the same queue, the completion by a player has precedence over the rising of a seed / evolving stages of another player within turn order.
##### *Express Completion*

Every player has a capacity to reserve one tile. With a bit of planning players might be able to do a double placement of emotiles (with the event-card played in-between), resulting with express completion of an emotion.
##### Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
*set collection of recognised emotions*

Building sets of emotions enriches our EQ. A set can contain **recognised** emotions or  regularly experienced emotions trough personas. When different personas we are connected with have the same emotions more than once, these could be distributed among different sets when accounting. The player earns colorless crystals equal to the number of recognised emotions on completion of each set.
##### *Triggering (Emotional) Patterns*

Every player has one or more patterns as the side-result of their relationships with different personas. Players have to keep an eye on completed emotions on their queue for a potential match of a sequence (even with other emotions in-between) with one of the personas. If such a match occurs, players lose of their colored crystals within the round, stopping them to play further. Players have to take special care to dismantle these patterns from their queue.
## A Typical Turn:

- The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Player may match with a partner if not done already which ends their turn.
- Pick up the emotile by following its [[#Picking Up EmoTiles|rules]] (as mentioned above), 
- Play the event-card by paying its cost/receiving its benefit with crystals of their color. The paid amount goes to their reserve.
- They move one of their markers from the shoshin-track to the axis' matching the event-card onto the connecting space to the emotile they want to take.
- Player **may** use a previously reserved tile, if present.
- Either apply the picked tile(-s) to the end of a *queue* or put it as reserved aside.
- Carry out the results of the played card. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes for each player when there aren't enough crystals for playing cards. Players with enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns or they may only pass **after** at least one player already passed. Saving up crystals is a good way to prepare for the next round.
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- Persona cards will be replaced with five new ones, 
- Players:
	- any reserved emotiles and remaining cards in their hand gets discarded,
	- draws a new set of 6 cards,
	- adds 12 crystals from their storage
	- discard one of their persona cards.
- Decide on the new player order by the number of clear crystals in reverse order. If tie occurs, the player with the shorter queue has precedence.
