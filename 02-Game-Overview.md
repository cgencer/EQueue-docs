As within our life, players build up emotions in relation with others, sometimes creating a ripple-effect of sequenced emotions, triggering patterns and actions leading to new emotions. Emotions and various events change our expectancies, silently motivating us for  actions. Every player has to watch out for his inherited and learned emotional patterns as they'd cost awareness which is hardly earned.
## The Objective

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players are not able to continue and pass. 

The goal of the player is to get awareness of each ones emotional atmosphere by: 
- reach a state called shoshin (to have a genuine curiousity)
- while experiencing emotions without clinging / attachment
- be aware of getting triggered by emotional patterns, trying to dissolve these
- reach equilibrium through exercising the middle path on our intern motivations
- dismantle our emotional patterns.
- and optionally investigate and dismantle layered emotions.

**While doing this, they will try to convert their coloured crystals into blank ones. At the end of the game, the player with the most blank crystals wins.**
#### Emotional Continuity

Cultivating the continuity of others' rising emotion is a players priority. Players compete each other by attaching emotiles to others queues to fulfil rising emotions. Getting triggered of one own patterns is a not preferred side-effect where every person has to deal with it on their own.
## A Typical Turn:

The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Players pick emotion tiles matching the tiles' axes with one of their event cards' axis by these rules:
	- a) The tile has to have a connection (shown with the lines of the grid) to the axis of a card in hand. 
	- b) The player should have a matching card with the connected axis.
	- c) The connection also has to be free of the players disc-markers.
	- d) (If the tile is to be played directly) the tile has to match a queue.
	- e) The shoshin-track of the player has remaining disc-markers to take from.
	- f) If the visible of the emotile do not match a queue, and the player still takes it the tile and the event-card -without using its effects- is discarded, its location still to be marked with a disc.
	- g) The player should have enough crystals (of his colour) to activate the card.
	- h) Order of card activation and tile placement does not matter.
- Pick up the emotile by moving one of your disc-markers from the shoshin-track to the connected axis' free space.
- Pay the cost of the event-card with crystals of their colour.
- Attach the gathered tile to the *queue* of another player, matching at least one colour stripe.
- Carry out the results of the played card, action and / or crystals. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes when all players can't play anymore because their crystals are not enough / finished. Players having enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns. They **may** also pass the round while having enough crystals (to spend these on the next round) **after** at least one player passes. When all players pass, the round finishes. 
## Preparation for Upcoming Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- All activated cards will be discarded,
- Reserved and not used emotile & event-cards will be discarded without the benefits.
- Players draw a next set of 6 cards,
- Players discard one of the persona cards, wile keeping its pattern tile.
