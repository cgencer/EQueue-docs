EQueue is a semi-abstract and semi-coop tactical puzzle with a good amount of player interaction. Players trigger emotions of others, sometimes creating a ripple-effect of sequenced emotions, with its pros and cons. Experience is gained trough various events, in the form of event cards. Using emotions and events changes our level of motivation on several aspects, which in turn becomes the motivator for other emotions and events. Every player also has to watch out for his emotional patterns, as they would cost precious awareness which is not easily gathered. 

The goal of the game is to raise our mindfulness by: 
- reach a state called shoshin,
- reach equilibrium trough exercising the middle path; on emotions and experiences, 
- dismantle our patterns, which shadow our shoshin-state.

Beside the fact that EQueue is a game on its own, EQueue is also an impansion (a crucial internal part) for the game Samsara. Various modules expand EQueue into Samsara and others will be added to Samsara to enrich the game-quality.
