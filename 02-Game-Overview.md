EQueue is a semi-abstract & semi-coop tactical puzzle with lots of player interaction. Players trigger emotions of others, sometimes creating a ripple-effect of sequenced emotions, repetitious sequences building new patterns. Patterns of emotions has a side effect of memorization, shadowing our decisions and leading one living things within their mind, but reality; also loosing awareness as a side-result. Beside it is a game on its own, EQueue is also an impansion (a crucial internal expansion) for the game Samsara. Various modules expand EQueue into Samsara.

Players play out cards of various events, raise tendencies to gather emotions, play these onto the queues, sometimes triggering their patterns. Every player also has to watch out for his emotional patterns, as they would cost awareness.
