Emotions alter our expactations, motivating us towards new experiences and these create new emotions, all within a closed loop. Our loved ones contribute to this cycle by supplying us with various preset behaviours and patterns.

Players pick up and build up emotions onto queues, triggering patterns and activating events, which lead to new emotions. By experiencing our daily lives we regularly experience emotions. Recognising and handling emotions should be done mindfully and we should give attention to what we may trigger upon our beloved ones.

## The Objective

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or cards in their hand. Players compete with each other by applying emotiles to others queue strategically. The costs is players attention / awareness, paid with crystals in players colors. As a result of their choices, actions and applied emotiles, players collect clear (colorless) crystals throughout the game. By the end of fifth round, the player who has the most clear crystals wins.



## A Typical Turn:

Player may:
- match with a partner if not done already (ending their turn),
- Pick up an emotile, 
- Play an event card,
- Use a previously reserved tile, if present.
- Hold the picked up tile as reserved.
- Carry out the results of the played card.
The order which these actions are taken depend on the strategy of the player.
## End of the Round

The current round finishes for each player when the crystals are not enough to play the remaining cards. Players with enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns or they may only pass **after** at least one player already passed. Saving up crystals is a good way to prepare for the next round.
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the board will be filled up with new tiles,
- Persona cards will be replaced with five new ones, 
- Players:
	- any reserved emotiles and remaining cards in their hand gets discarded,
	- draws a new set of 6 cards,
	- adds 9 colored crystals from the storage
	- retire (set aside) one of their persona cards.
- Decide on the new player order by the number of clear crystals in reverse order. If tie occurs, the player with the shorter queue has precedence. 
## Tracking Score

Players evolvement is tracked with the clear crystals symbolizing pure, unattached mindset they earn carrying out various actions.
