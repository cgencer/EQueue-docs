Players build up emotions onto others queues, sometimes creating a ripple-effect of sequenced emotions, triggering patterns and activating events which lead to new emotions. Emotions alter our expectancies, motivating us away from the middle path towards more experiences. Every player has to watch out for his inherited and learned emotional patterns as they'd cost awareness which is hardly earned. With the included optional expansion, players also might be able to dismantle emotions to discover the layered-nature of them.
## The Objective

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or cards in hand. In their turn players pick emotiles, activate cards, (may) apply tile(-s) to queue(-s) and fulfil the results of any actions of cards in their turn. Each player has one slot to reserve a tile.

The goal of each player is to increase their mindfulness through their emotional atmosphere by: 
- reach a state called *shoshin* (to have a genuine curiosity) and equilibrium by exercising *the middle path* on our intern motivations
- build *emotional continuity* and *experience (emotions) without attachment*
- be mindful for *triggering patterns*, dissolve these when possible
- and optionally investigate and *dismantle layered emotions*.
#### *Shoshin State & Equilibrium*

Raising our tendencies and experiencing a known set of emotions (a ka patterns) regularly results with a loss of shoshin state. While we use the motivation axes to play event-cards, to increase our mindfulness, we have to keep the number of markers as low as possible on each of the axes. The first level on each axis is an acceptable minimum, any markers above that lowers our shoshin-track. This is *The Middle Path*.
#### *Experience Without Attachment*


#### *Emotional Continuity*

Cultivating (and fulfilling) the seeded emotions is every players priority. Players compete with each other by attaching emotiles to the end of others queue by matching at least one of the colored stripes. 
#### *Triggering (Emotional) Patterns*

Every player has one or more patterns, results of the relationship with different personas. 
They have to watch out if the fulfilled colors in the middle of their queue contains a matching color-sequence. When a triggering happens, it results with loss of awareness (crystals) and/or some emotions *resurfacing*.
Thats why a player has to be aware of these patterns, avoid and/or dismantle them.
#### *Dismantling Emotions*


## A Typical Turn:

- The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Players pick emotiles according these rules:
	- a) The marker-space of one of the two the adjacent axes with a matching card in-hand still has a space for the disc-marker.
	- b) The space shouldn't be already occupied by the player.
	- c) The shoshin-track of the player should have disc-markers to take from.
	- d) **(If the tile is to be played directly)** the tile has to match a queue.
		**(else, to reserve a tile)** Unless no reserved tile for the player exist the tile could be still taken even If its visible side do not match any queue. The matching event-card will be activated and the location has to be marked with the players disc.
	- e) The player should have enough crystals (of his color) to activate the matching card.
	- f) Order of card activation and tile placement do not matter.
- Pick up the emotile by moving one of your disc-markers from the shoshin-track to the connected axis' free space.
- Pay the cost (or receive) of the event-card with crystals of their color.
- Apply the gathered tile to the end of the *queue* of another player, matching at least one color stripe.
- Carry out the results of the played card if any, action and/or crystals. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes when players can't play anymore because their crystals are not enough / finished. Players having enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns. **After** at least one player passes players **may** also pass their round (**NOT** turn) while having enough crystals to spend these on the next round. When all players pass, the round finishes. 
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- All activated cards will be discarded,
- All persona cards will be replaced with five new personas, 
- Reserved and not used emotile & event-cards will be discarded without their benefits.
- Players draw a next set of 6 cards.
- Players discard one of their persona cards, wile keeping its pattern tile active.
