Emotions alter our expectancies, motivating us towards new experiences. Players pick up and build up emotions onto others queues, triggering patterns and activating events which lead to new emotions. 
Every player also has to watch out and dismantle the emotional patterns costing us some awareness which is rare these days. 
With the included optional expansion, players also might able to dismantle emotions to discover the layered-nature of them.
## The Objective
^0f9129

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or unactivated cards in their hand. In turn-order they pick emotiles, activate cards, apply tile(-s) to queue(-s) and fulfil the results of any actions of cards in their turn. 

The goal of each player is to increase their mindfulness through their emotional awareness by: 
- reach a state called *[[13-Appendix#^d822f1|shoshin]]* and equilibrium by exercising *[[13-Appendix#^dcd6f9|the middle path]]* on our intern motivations
- build *[[#Emotional Continuity]]* with *[[#Awareness of Emotions|awareness of emotions]]*.
- be mindful for *triggering patterns*, dissolve these
- and optionally investigate and *dismantle layered emotions*.
##### *Shoshin State & Equilibrium*

Raising our tendencies and experiencing a known set of emotions (a ka patterns) regularly results with a loss of shoshin state. While we use the motivation axes to play event-cards, to increase our mindfulness, we have to keep the number of markers as low as possible on each of the axes. The first level on each axis is an acceptable minimum, any markers above that lowers our shoshin-track. This is *The Middle Path*.
##### *Emotional Continuity*

*Please refer to [[06-Tiles#^666a75|Emotiles]] for a detailed information.*

Players compete with each other by attaching emotiles to the end of others queue by matching at least one of the colored stripes on the previous tile.

***A Single Emotile:** The dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellowÂ and in the center light green.*

When tiles are attached consecutively a continuity of a color-stripe becomes visible throughout the tiles. It represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion, from outermost level *(seed)* to the second-level *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third-level *(becoming)*, form a visual checkmark facing either left or right (the side has no meaning).
##### Awareness of Emotions and Removing Attachment

The rising of an emotion is an interplay between others and us. The first two stages are created by other players attaching tiles onto our queue. If we are aware of the risen emotion by completing its last stage we earn another awareness crystal (from our storage) for practicing mindfulness. The risen emotion with its three stages get discarded from the queue. In this way our attachment to the emotion has been removed. But if others get it done before we were able to, we will loose one crystal and they will receive a crystal (from their storage) because we haven't been aware of this arising.

Because every player has a capacity to reserve a tile, they can do a double placement of emotiles (with the event-card played in-between), resulting with direct completion of risen emotions.
##### *Triggering (Emotional) Patterns*

Every player has one or more patterns as the outcome of their relationships (with personas). Players have to watch out if completed emotions matches the color-sequence of a pattern even with other emotions in-between. When one of our patterns emerges it results initiates a crisis, resulting with loss of all crystals for this round. Players have to prioritize to watch out for these patterns and dismantle them.
## A Typical Turn:

- The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Players pick emotiles according these rules:
	- a) The marker-space of one of the two the adjacent axes with a matching card in-hand still has a space for the disc-marker.
	- b) The space shouldn't be already occupied by the player.
	- c) The shoshin-track of the player should have disc-markers to take from.
	- d) **(If the tile is to be played directly)** the tile has to match a queue.
		**(else, to reserve a tile)** An unmatching tile could be still taken **unless no reserved tile** for the player exists. Refer to [[09-Special-Actions#^dd5bad|Special Actions: Reserving EmoTiles]].
	- e) The player should have enough crystals (of his color) to activate the matching card.
	- f) Order of card activation and tile placement do not matter.
- Pick up the emotile by moving one of your disc-markers from the shoshin-track to the connected axis' free space.
- Pay the cost (or receive) of the event-card with crystals of their color.
- Apply the gathered tile(-s) to the end of the *queue*s, matching at least one color stripe.
- Carry out the results of the played card if any, action and/or crystals. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes when players can't play anymore because their crystals are not enough / finished. Players having enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns. **After** at least one player passes players **may** also pass their round (**NOT** turn) while having enough crystals to spend these on the next round. When all players pass, the round finishes. 
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- All activated cards will be discarded,
- All persona cards will be replaced with five new personas, 
- Reserved and not used emotile & event-cards will be discarded without their benefits.
- Players draw a next set of 6 cards and each player takes 16 crystals from their storage.
- Players discard one of their persona cards, while keeping the narrrative tiles idle.
