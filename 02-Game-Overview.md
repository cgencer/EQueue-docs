EQueue is a semi-abstract, semi-coop tactical puzzle with a good amount of player interaction and a pinch of strategy. Players trigger emotions of others, sometimes creating a ripple-effect of sequenced emotions, with its pros and cons. Experience is gained trough various events, in the form of event cards. Using emotions and events changes our level of motivation on several aspects, which in turn becomes the motivator for other emotions and events. Every player also has to watch out for his emotional patterns, as they would cost precious awareness which is not easily gathered. 

Beside the fact that EQueue is a game on its own, EQueue is also an impansion (a crucial internal part) for the game Samsara. Various modules expand EQueue into Samsara and others will be added to Samsara to enrich the game-quality.

The goal of the game is to raise our mindfulness by: 
- reach a state called shoshin,
- detach emotions while still being open to experience them, 
- reach equilibrium trough exercising the middle path; on emotions and experiences, 
- dismantle our patterns, which shadow our shoshin-state.
## The Objective

The game is played over three rounds. A round continues until all players pass. The game is finished after three rounds. The goal of each player is to nurture mindfulness, be aware of their emotional atmosphere, watch out and dissolve patterns and balance their tendency-axes while navigating through various events within life. While doing this, they will try to convert their coloured crystals into colourless (unattached) ones. At the end of the game, the player with the most colorless crystals wins.
## A Typical Turn:

- Players pick emotion tiles fitting to one of the queue's through matching the tiles' connected axes with one of their event cards axis subject,
- Pays the cost of the event-card with awareness-crystals of their colour.
- Attach the received tile to the matching *queue*s of the other players.
- Carry out the results of the played card, action and / or crystals.
