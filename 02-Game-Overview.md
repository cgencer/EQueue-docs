Emotions alter our expectancies, motivating us towards new experiences. Players pick up and build up emotions onto queues, sometime triggering patterns and activating events which lead to new emotions. Experiencing events lead to new emotions, preferably to new ones. Dealing and taking care of your emotions needs to be practiced wisely and among family, friends and our partners, we also should give attention to what we may trigger upon them as well.

With the included optional expansion, players also might able to dismantle emotions to discover and understand the layered-nature of them.
## The Objective
^0f9129

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or unactivated cards in their hand. Players compete with each other by attaching emotiles to the end of others queue by matching at least one of the colored stripes on the previous tile. They will use crystals in their color to pay where awareness is required, mostly on activating the event-cards. By choices, actions and the emotions we handle, we collect clear (colorless) crystals throughout the game. By the end of fifth round, the player who has the most clear crystals wins.

Various methods exist where we spend/earn awareness crystals and/or collect clear crystals:
- being in a state called *[[13-Appendix#^d822f1|shoshin]]* and equilibrium by exercising *[[13-Appendix#^dcd6f9|the middle path]]*
- build *[[#Emotional Continuity|emotional continuity]]* by *[[#Recognising Emotions|recognising emotions]]*.
- collecting sets of experienced emotions and self-completed emotions.
- dissolving own *triggering patterns*
- and optionally investigating and *dismantling layered emotions*.
##### The Crystals, The Currency of Awareness and Mindfulness

Colored crystals act as our awareness, tinted with our personality color. Throughout the game our actions and choices require our intention and awareness applied to a given situation; it's just like we pay with some awareness to experience things, but in this way we diminish our awareness. 
During the game we should strive to cultivate mindfulness, to be unbiased and attachment-free. The colorless blank crystals represent our evolvement as a focused and untainted mindfulness. 
##### *Shoshin State & Equilibrium*

Shoshin is a Zen (japanese buddhist way) term describing a mindset preferring the eagerness to learn over previous memories. The more you know about a subject, the more likely you are to close your mind to further learning.
Increasing motivations and playing within a known set of emotions is a loss of our shoshin state. Playing event-cards increase our motivations, but cultivating mindfulness requires us to keep the distribution of markers low. The first level on each axis is an acceptable minimum, any markers above that lowers our shoshin-track.
##### *Emotional Continuity*

*Please refer to [[06-Tiles#^666a75|Emotiles]] for a detailed information.*

![[tile.jpg]]
***A Single Emotile:** The dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellowÂ and in the center light green.*

By attaching tiles consecutively the stripes form a visible checkmark throughout the tiles. It represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion from outermost stripe as first stage *(seed)* to its second stage *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third stage *(completion)* fulfills the emotion, facing either left or right (towards us or other, which bears no importance).
##### Recognising Emotions
*take-that interplay of emotions*

The rising of an emotion is an interplay of emotions between the players. Every player has to be mindful of their emotions. As players seed and evolve emotions onto others queue's we need to be aware the rising emotions and handle it trough recognising (completing the last step by our action). We earn a (colored) crystal (from storage) for usage within the next turns.
If we don't/can't give enough attention and it will be completed by others, we'll loose one crystal. 

When we were able to complete, break the last three tiles out of the queue, save the last ompleting) piece and discard the the others. These saved tiles form a collection of our *[[#Emotional Intelligence (EQ)]]*.

*Priority of Tiles, Express Completion*

When a completion happens while another rises, the completion has priority. A completion by one player has precedence over the rising of a seed / evolving stages of another player, of course within turn order.

Because every player has a capacity to reserve one tile, with a bit of planning they can do a double placement of emotiles (with the event-card played in-between), resulting with express completion of an emotion.
##### Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
*set collection of experienced and completed emotions*

Experiencing and learning to deal with a variety of emotions builds up our emotional intelligence. Building sets of emotions enriches our EQ. A set can be built either with **recognised** emotions or trough a mixed set of recognised and the experienced emotions with personas. Several of the same emotion could be distributed among different sets, but only one appearance is allowed. The number of sets completed acts as a multiplier for the total number of clear crystals.
##### *Triggering (Emotional) Patterns*

Every player has one or more patterns as the side-result of their relationships (with personas). Players have to watch out if completed emotions matches the sequence of a pattern even with other emotions in-between. An emerging pattern results with the loss of all colored crystals, stopping player to play further within the round. Players have to take special care to watch out for these patterns and dismantle them.
## A Typical Turn:

- The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Players pick emotiles according these rules:
	- a) The marker-space of one of the two the adjacent axes with a matching card in-hand still has a space for the disc-marker.
	- b) The space shouldn't be already occupied by the player.
	- c) The shoshin-track of the player should have disc-markers to take from.
	- d) **(If the tile is to be played directly)** the tile has to match a queue.
		**(else, to reserve a tile)** An unmatching tile could be still taken **unless no reserved tile** for the player exists. Refer to [[09-Special-Actions#^dd5bad|Special Actions: Reserving EmoTiles]].
	- e) The player should have enough crystals (of his color) to activate the matching card.
	- f) Order of card activation and tile placement do not matter.
- Pick up the emotile by moving one of your disc-markers from the shoshin-track to the connected axis' free space.
- Pay the cost (or receive) of the event-card with crystals of their color.
- Apply the gathered tile(-s) to the end of the *queue*s, matching at least one color stripe.
- Carry out the results of the played card if any, action and/or crystals. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes when players can't play anymore because their crystals are not enough / finished. Players having enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns. **After** at least one player passes players **may** also pass their round (**NOT** turn) while having enough crystals to spend these on the next round. When all players pass, the round finishes. 
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- All activated cards will be discarded,
- All persona cards will be replaced with five new personas, 
- Reserved and not used emotile & event-cards will be discarded without their benefits.
- Players draw a next set of 6 cards and each player takes 16 crystals from their storage.
- Players discard one of their persona cards, while keeping the narrative tiles idle.
