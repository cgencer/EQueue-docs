Emotions alter our expectancies, motivating us towards new experiences. Players pick up and build up emotions onto others queues, triggering patterns and activating events which lead to new emotions. 
Every player also has to watch out and dismantle the emotional patterns costing us some awareness which is rare these days. 
With the included optional expansion, players also might able to dismantle emotions to discover the layered-nature of them.
## The Objective
^0f9129

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or unactivated cards in their hand. Players have colored awareness crystals to pay where awareness is required, most of all on activating the event-cards. 
The goal of each player is to collect clear (colorless) crystals throughout the game. In turn-order they pick emotiles, activate cards, apply tile(-s) to queue(-s) and fulfil the results of any actions of cards in their turn. By the end of fifth round, the player who has the most clear crystals wins.

Various places exist where we spend / earn awareness crystals or collect clear crystals:
- being in a state called *[[13-Appendix#^d822f1|shoshin]]* and equilibrium by exercising *[[13-Appendix#^dcd6f9|the middle path]]*
- build *[[#Emotional Continuity|emotional continuity]]* by *[[#Recognising Emotions|recognising emotions]]*.
- collecting sets of experienced emotions and self-completed emotions.
- dissolving own *triggering patterns*
- and optionally investigating and *dismantling layered emotions*.
##### *Shoshin State & Equilibrium*

Raising our tendencies and experiencing a known set of emotions (a ka patterns) regularly results with a loss of shoshin state. While we use the motivation axes to play event-cards, to increase our mindfulness, we have to keep the number of markers as low as possible on each of the axes. The first level on each axis is an acceptable minimum, any markers above that lowers our shoshin-track. This is *The Middle Path*.
##### *Emotional Continuity*

*Please refer to [[06-Tiles#^666a75|Emotiles]] for a detailed information.*

Players compete with each other by attaching emotiles to the end of others queue by matching at least one of the colored stripes on the previous tile.

***A Single Emotile:** The dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellowÂ and in the center light green.*

By attaching tiles consecutively the stripes form a visible checkmark throughout the tiles. It represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion from outermost stage *(seed)* to its second stage *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third stage *(completion)* fulfills the emotion, facing either left or right (towards us or other, which bears no importance).
##### Recognising Emotions
*take-that interplay of emotions*

The rising of an emotion is an interplay between other players and us. The first two stages are created by other players attaching tiles onto our queue. If we recognise the risen emotion by completing its last stage we earn a colored crystal (from our storage) for using with next turns. Break the last three tiles out of the queue, save the last tile and discard the 1st and 2nd stage tiles. These completed and saved tiles form a collection of our *emotional intelligence (EQ)*.

When a completion happens while another rises, the completion has priority. A completion by one player has precedence over the rising of a seed / evolving stages of another player, of course within turn order.

But if others are able to get the checkmark done before us we'll loose one crystal because we haven't been aware of and recognised this emotion.

Because every player has a capacity to reserve one tile, with a bit of planning they can do a double placement of emotiles (with the event-card played in-between), resulting with express completion of an emotion.
##### Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
*set collection of experienced and completed emotions*

Experiencing and learning to deal with a variety of emotions builds up our emotional intelligence. A set can also be built only with completed emotions or with a mixed set of  through experienced emotions with personas plus the completed emotions through recognising. Several emotions on personas could be distributed among several sets. The number of sets completed acts as a multiplier for the total number of clear crystals.
##### *Triggering (Emotional) Patterns*

Every player has one or more patterns as the outcome of their relationships (with personas). Players have to watch out if completed emotions matches the color-sequence of a pattern even with other emotions in-between. When one of our patterns emerges it results initiates a crisis, resulting with loss of all colored crystals for this round. Players have to prioritize to watch out for these patterns and dismantle them.
## A Typical Turn:

- The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Players pick emotiles according these rules:
	- a) The marker-space of one of the two the adjacent axes with a matching card in-hand still has a space for the disc-marker.
	- b) The space shouldn't be already occupied by the player.
	- c) The shoshin-track of the player should have disc-markers to take from.
	- d) **(If the tile is to be played directly)** the tile has to match a queue.
		**(else, to reserve a tile)** An unmatching tile could be still taken **unless no reserved tile** for the player exists. Refer to [[09-Special-Actions#^dd5bad|Special Actions: Reserving EmoTiles]].
	- e) The player should have enough crystals (of his color) to activate the matching card.
	- f) Order of card activation and tile placement do not matter.
- Pick up the emotile by moving one of your disc-markers from the shoshin-track to the connected axis' free space.
- Pay the cost (or receive) of the event-card with crystals of their color.
- Apply the gathered tile(-s) to the end of the *queue*s, matching at least one color stripe.
- Carry out the results of the played card if any, action and/or crystals. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes when players can't play anymore because their crystals are not enough / finished. Players having enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns. **After** at least one player passes players **may** also pass their round (**NOT** turn) while having enough crystals to spend these on the next round. When all players pass, the round finishes. 
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- All activated cards will be discarded,
- All persona cards will be replaced with five new personas, 
- Reserved and not used emotile & event-cards will be discarded without their benefits.
- Players draw a next set of 6 cards and each player takes 16 crystals from their storage.
- Players discard one of their persona cards, while keeping the narrrative tiles idle.
