Emotions alter our expectancies, motivating us towards new experiences and these in turn create new emotions, all in a closed loop. Our inner circle of loved ones contribute to this cycle, by supplying us with preset behaviours and patterns.

Players pick up and build up emotions onto queues, triggering patterns and activating events which lead to new emotions. Experiencing events lead to new emotions, preferably to new ones. Accepting and handling own emotions should be done wisely and among our family, we should give attention to what we may trigger upon them as well. Being mindful of these helps us build up a harmonious life.

## The Objective

The game is played over five rounds. A round continues until all players finish their crystals or cards in their hand. Players compete with each other by applying emotiles to others queue strategically. The costs is done with attention / awareness, by crystals in players colors. As a result of their choices, actions and applied emotiles, players collect clear (colorless) crystals throughout the game. By the end of fifth round, the player who has the most clear crystals wins.
## A Typical Turn:

- The gameplay is focused on the circular board and the players queue's.
- Player may match with a partner if not done already which ends their turn.
- Pick up the emotile by following its [[#Picking Up EmoTiles|rules]] (as mentioned above), 
- Play the event-card by paying its cost/receiving its benefit with crystals of their color. The paid amount goes to their reserve.
- They move one of their markers from the shoshin-track to the axis' matching the event-card onto the connecting space to the emotile they want to take.
- Player **may** use a previously reserved tile, if present.
- Either apply the picked tile(-s) to the end of a *queue* or put it as reserved aside.
- Carry out the results of the played card. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes for each player when there aren't enough crystals for playing cards. Players with enough crystals **may** continue to play their turns or they may only pass **after** at least one player already passed. Saving up crystals is a good way to prepare for the next round.
#### Preparation for the Next Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- Persona cards will be replaced with five new ones, 
- Players:
	- any reserved emotiles and remaining cards in their hand gets discarded,
	- draws a new set of 6 cards,
	- adds 12 colored crystals from the storage
	- retire (set aside) one of their persona cards.
- Decide on the new player order by the number of clear crystals in reverse order. If tie occurs, the player with the shorter queue has precedence. 
## Tracking Score

Players evolvement is tracked with the clear crystals, symbolizing pure, unattached mindset they earn. Throughout the game, they earn or loose crystals by:
- +1 crystal on each card played by their event,
- +1 crystal on each recognised emotion,
- +n crystal on each recognised emotion of a set of emotions (emotions from the personas contributing to a set shouldn't be counted)
- -3 crystals when a pattern is triggered.
- 
At the game end, these alter the count of crystals:
- +value of the persona cards (both in-play and retired)
- -number of markers used on the axes
