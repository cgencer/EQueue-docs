EQueue is a semi-abstract, semi-coop tactical puzzle with a good amount of player interaction and a pinch of strategy. Players trigger emotions of others, sometimes creating a ripple-effect of sequenced emotions, with its pros and cons. Experience is gained trough various events, in the form of event cards. Using emotions and events changes our level of motivation on several aspects, which in turn becomes the motivator for other emotions and events. Every player also has to watch out for his emotional patterns, as they would cost precious awareness which is not easily gathered. 

Beside the fact that EQueue is a game on its own, EQueue is also an impansion (a crucial internal part) for the game Samsara. Various modules expand EQueue into Samsara and others will be added to Samsara to enrich the game-quality.

The goal of the game is to raise our mindfulness by: 
- reach a state called shoshin,
- detach emotions while still being open to experience them, 
- reach equilibrium trough exercising the middle path; on emotions and experiences, 
- dismantle our patterns, which shadow our shoshin-state.
## The Objective

The game is played over three rounds. A round continues until all players pass. The game is finished after three rounds. The goal of each player is to nurture mindfulness, be aware of their emotional atmosphere, watch out and dissolve patterns and balance their tendency-axes while navigating through various events within life. While doing this, they will try to convert their coloured crystals into blank ones. At the end of the game, the player with the most blank crystals wins.
## A Typical Turn:

The gameplay is focused on the circular board and all players queue's.
- Players pick emotion tiles matching the tiles' axes with one of their event cards' axis by these rules:
	- a) The tile has to have a connection (shown with the lines of the grid) to the axis of a card in hand. 
	- b) The player should have a matching card with the connected axis.
	- c) The connection also has to be free of the players disc-markers.
	- d) (If the tile is to be played directly) the tile has to match a queue.
	- e) The shoshin-track of the player still has remaining disc-markers to take from.
	- f) If either the visible- or its back-side do not match a queue, the tile and the event-card -without using its effects- is discarded, its location still to be marked with a disc.
	- g) The player should have enough crystals to activate the card.
	- h) Order of card activation and tile placement don't matter.
- Pay the cost of the event-card with awareness-crystals of their colour.
- Attach the gathered tile to the *queue*s of another player by matching at least one colour stripe.
- Carry out the results of the played card, action and / or crystals. 
## End of Round

The current round finishes when all players can't play furthermore because their crystals are not enough / finished. Players having enough crystals **may** continue playing their turns. They may also pass the round while having enough crystals to spend these on the next round **after** at least one player passes. When all players pass, the round finishes. 

## Preparation for Upcoming Round:

- Empty spaces on the sectors will be filled up with emotiles,
- All activated cards will be discarded,
- Players draw a next set of 6 cards,
- Players discard one of the persona cards, wile keeping its pattern tile.
