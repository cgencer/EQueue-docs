*Please refer to [[13-Appendix#^024396]] for a detailed description.*

Every persona has a different emotional narrative picked when we build relationship with them. These act as our personal missions within the game. They contain inherited patterns, tendencies and emotional experiences (memories).

Narrative tiles are separated into two groups for parents and partners. Partners having less features as parents, they don't have inherited patterns. Please rake care to take the correct tiles for every persona.

- ### Tendencies and Traumatic Issues:
*asymmetric player states, setup parameters*

These are the strategies we've developed as a result of the emotional narratives with our parents. They will be applied only on the setup stage of the game.

Traumatic issues create a stronger motivation / tendency on various axes, which will move us strongly away from the middle path.

- ### (Inherited) Patterns:

 Patterns are learned emotional behaviours, maybe strategies. The familiarity of these results with earning advantages while loosing some awareness. Whenever our queue establishes such a sequence (initiated by others) we experience the pattern. Every establishment of the pattern fortifies the results. Although they return some advantages, it is also mandatory to dismantle them in order to loose less.

- ### Emotional Memories:
- ##### Major (Triggering) Emotion:
  When using the layered emotions add-on, this color will be the entrance for dismantling layered emotions. Otherwise it is only the most-occurring emotion of the personas narrative. 
- ##### Regular Emotions:
  Both the major and regular emotions show the experienced emotions in relation with each persona. The combined 'emotional knowledge' on all personas emotional narratives show us our experienced emotions, from where we subtract the emotions which we still need to learn from. The unpracticed emotions have discount incentive on crystals paid.
