Emotions are a way to connect and experience the reality we live in. We feel, we build relationship trough these emotions, we decide and take action and all within a loop a causality. With emotions we're socially connected and intertwined with all sentient beings. 

EQueue is a semi-abstract, semi-coop tactical puzzle with a good amount of player interaction and a pinch of strategy. Not only does it provide a tactical game, it also provides a simple toolkit to understand and deal with the emotions from a holistic perspective. It uses various frameworks of ideas, both form the ancient eastern philosophies and social sciences of western thinkers.

Beside the fact that EQueue is a game on its own, EQueue can also be expanded into the game Samsara (which will also be coming up), a medium-heavy strategy game trough various modules.
