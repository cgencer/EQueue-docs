Emotions are a way to connect and experience the reality we live in. We feel, we build relationship trough these emotions, we decide and take action; all within a loop a cause and effect. With emotions we're socially connected with all sentient beings. 

EQueue is a semi-abstract tactical puzzle game about emotions with a good amount of player interaction and a pinch of strategy. It also provides a simple toolkit to understand and deal with the emotions from a holistic perspective. The roots spring from various frameworks of ideas, both form ancient eastern philosophies and modern social sciences of western thinkers. Beside its inteaction-packed, fun, competitive and semi-cooperative game-values, it also gives clues on handling emotions in an unorthodox way which are based on both buddhist understanding and daoist observations. Our societies could elevate themselves to a more harmonious life-style by raising our emotional intelligence and mindful-approaches.

This game is designed after having years of study on buddhism and daoism,  combined with the joy of board gaming.
