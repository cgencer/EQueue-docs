Emotions are a way to connect and experience the reality we live in. We feel, we build relationship trough these emotions, we decide and take action; all within a loop a cause and effect. With emotions we're socially connected with all sentient beings. 

EQueue is a semi-abstract and semi-cooperative tactical puzzle game about emotions with a good amount of player interaction and a pinch of strategy. Players initiate emotions with others, deal with preset patterns of sequenced emotions, sometimes even trigger instant emotions and try to overcome the emotions issues inherited from their parents. The goal of the game is to show how to cultivate mindfulness within our emotional realm by staying in a curious state of shoshin, be unbiased, peaceful and have a flexible mind.

The game also provides a simple understanding of the nature of emotions and help to deal with the emotions from a holistic perspective. Its basis comes from various frameworks of deeply established thoughts, both form ancient eastern philosophies and modern social sciences of western thinkers. 

Beside its interaction-packed, fun, competitive but semi-cooperative game-values, it also gives clues on handling emotions in an unorthodox way. These are based on both buddhist and daoist observations and understandings of human nature. Our societies could elevate themselves to a better harmonious life-style by raising our emotional intelligence and cultivating mindful approaches.

This game is designed after having years of study and practice on meditation, buddhism and daoism, combined with lots of joy for board gaming.
