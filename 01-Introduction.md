Emotions are a way to connect and experience the reality we live in. 

Trough emotions we're socially connected and intertwined with all sentient beings. As much as experiencing them is important, so is becoming aware of them helps us to navigate within this realm to achieve a peaceful and harmonious life.

Social sciences help us understand emotions, their causes, effects and results by analysing and classifying them. Buddhism also has a deep insight about their nature, how they become and evolve.

Buddha observed a musician tuning the strings of his instrument, discovering adjustment of the strings to loose or tense resulted with no good sounds. *The middle path* where only the minimal required amount is applied -no more, no less- would be the best solution. Applied to emotions, this method could help us learn about their nature and not trying to control, force or ignore them. 

Repeating emotional sequences become our *patterns*, sometimes even directing our behaviours because repetitive responses lead to having lesser awareness of the situation. Applying mindfulness trough observation brings understanding and dissolving patterns of emotions. This brings us closer to the mindful state within Zen 'Beginners Mind (*Shoshin*). The joy of shoshin and the freedom of being free of patterns can lead us to a harmonious life being in sync with the reality.
