Emotions are a way to connect and experience the reality we live in. We feel, we build relationship trough these emotions, we decide and take action; all within a loop a cause and effect. With emotions we're socially connected with all sentient beings. Emotions for some of our behaviours. 

EQueue is a semi-abstract tactical puzzle with a good amount of player interaction and a pinch of strategy. Adding to its entertainment value as a game it also provides a simple toolkit to understand and deal with the emotions from a holistic perspective. It uses various frameworks of ideas, both form ancient eastern philosophies and modern social sciences of western thinkers.

Beside the fact that EQueue is a game on its own, EQueue can also be expanded into the game Samsara (which will also be coming up), a medium-heavy strategy game trough various modules.
