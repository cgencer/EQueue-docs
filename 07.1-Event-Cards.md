## Event Cards
^f2190b

Event cards can be used in various ways:
- Either by playing their events by paying / receiving crystals
- As a trigger to instant emotions: If the player has an emotile saved with the middle color matching the instant activation color of the blitz icon, these cards have priority before all other cards. The saved emotile gets discarded to the bag. Playing these cards still costs crystals and their benefits and bonus actions are applied.
- By using the elemental conversion, event cards can used to assist or suppress the growth of an emotion onto any queue.

Event cards can contain the following contents and variables. Varying on each card some may present, some may not.
##### Cost / Benefit: 
Wether the player is paying or receiving crystals for activation of this card.
##### Instant Activation:
Some cards have a blitz-icon at the top right corner, colored with one of the eight emotion groups. If the player has an emotile saved in this color, this card has to be activated before all others, triggering also the saved emotion to be played onto a queue. 
##### Affected Axes:
Each event affects one of the axes by the event. The player uses one of the two axes matching his card with the board sectors to pick emotiles, leaving his marker on the used axis.
##### The Element of Cards:
The nature of an event is visible as the icon on the bottom-left corner and a matching border color, reflecting the elements water, wood, fire, earth and metal. The color of the element has no relation with the colors of emotions and are only used to differentiate the cards easily.
Beside the element icon is a reference table for elemental conversions. Please refer to Appendix 13.C for a detailed description and information on conversion.
##### Elemental Conversion Table:

Elements are connected to each other by nurturing or dominating relations. Each element -so their emotional results- can be either fed or fed by, can dominate or dominated by another element. This helps us to manipulate the outcome of events.

The reference table shows us how each element can be used as a source to foster emotions. 
The left side is used for targeting own queue, the right side for others' queue. 
The upper row for supporting and the lower for dominating (or destroying) the outcome. 

The player might target a queue to support or dominate emotions.
By using the supporting method the player completes (recognises) risen emotions or through dominating they might break emotional patterns re-occurring. By targeting others queue, players gain understanding of others' emotions. 

For a conversion, the player discards a selected card and picks an emotile from the bag with the targeted emotion and applies it onto a queue. On completing the checkmark, normal rules apply.
##### Extra Action:
Additional bonus actions available after the cards gets played. 
##### Income (stress / tranquility):
Events manipulate our peace (counted with the peace track) by contributing as stress or tranquility, moving the marker to either side.
##### Event Details, title & text:
Thematic content describing the event which either results with or is the result of the played emotile.

### Recognising Emotions: Nurturing and Suppressing

The rising of an emotion is an interaction between different players. 
As well as living impulsively too much so does non-recognising emotions could lead to undesired results and emotional turbulences.

Recognising raises our Emotional Intelligence (EQ) and mindfulness about them. As well as understanding our own emotions, so respecting others' also increase our EQ.

Players initiate and foster emotions through interacting with others (queues'). These emotions require attention to their results, thus need to be recognised and dealt with by either nurturing or suppressing.

Recognising is done by completion of own rising emotions; either completing it with a fitting emotile or regulating / suppressing them based on their elements. Players earn crystals in their color for their awareness. But if others act first, the player loses a crystal. 

At the end of the game, players count sets of completed emotions with the regular emotions of the personas building possibly several non-repeating sets. Only the number of completed emotions within each full set are scored.

##### *Instant Activation*

Cards with the blitz-icon on the top right corner need to be instantly activated (with its costs applied, of course) when the player acquires an emotile matching the color of the blitz. If the player has insufficient crystals they need to discard cards for 2 crystals each to pay for it. If their cards still are not enough to cover this cost, their turns are blocked for this round as the the toll of this unexpressed emotion becomes bigger.
