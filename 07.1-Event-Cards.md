## Event Cards
^f2190b

Event cards can be used in various ways:
- Either activate the event-card normally by paying / receiving its cost / benefit or activate them as upgraded by paying matching emotile with the color of the triangle as additional cost. Upgraded cards count as double at the end of the game. The paid emotile returns to the bag.
- If the player has an emotile saved with the main color matching the instant activation color (the blitz icon), these cards has to be played first before all other cards and the saved emotile gets discarded to the bag.
- By using the elemental conversion, event cards can either assist or suppress the growth of an emotion on any queue.

Event cards can contain the following contents and variables; varying on each card some may present, some may not.
##### Cost / Benefit: 
Wether the player is paying or receiving crystals for activation of this card.
##### Instant Activation:
Some cards have a blitz-icon at the top right corner, colored with one of the eight emotion groups. If the player has an emotile saved in this color, this card has to be activated before all others, triggering also the saved emotion to be played onto a queue. 
##### Upgrade Color:
A card with a colored triangle on the top right corner can be upgraded for counting as two at the end of the game. The upgrade costs a crystal and an additional emotile beside the regular cost of activation. The emotile for upgrade can be put onto the card to distinguish the upgraded ones from regular cards.
##### Affected Axes:
Each event affects one of the axes by the event. The player uses one of the two axes matching his card with the board sectors to pick emotiles, leaving his marker on the used axis.
##### Element:
The element icon shows the nature of the event as one of five elements; water, wood, fire, earth and metal. The cards can also be distinguished by their border color.
##### Elemental Conversion Table:
Each element converts from / to others differently, as shown on the reference table beside the element symbol. The left side is used for manipulating own, the right side for others' queue; the upper row for supporting and the lower for suppressing (or destroying) the outcome. Mode detail is available on the example usage and the **Theory of 5 Elements**.
##### Extra Action:
Additional bonus actions available after the cards gets played. 
##### Income (stress / tranquility):
Events manipulate our peace (counted with the peace track) by contributing as stress or tranquility, moving its marker to either side.
##### Event Details, title & text:
Thematic content describing the event which either results with or is the result of the played emotile.
