## Event Cards
^f2190b

Event cards can be used in various ways:
- Either by playing it normally by paying / receiving crystals
- Play them upgraded by paying matching emotile with the color of the up-facing triangle as additional cost. Upgraded cards count as double at the end of the game. The paid emotile returns to the bag.
- If the player has an emotile saved with the main color matching the instant activation color (the blitz icon), these cards has to be played first before all other cards and the saved emotile gets discarded to the bag.
- By using the elemental conversion, event cards can either assist or suppress the growth of an emotion on any queue.

Event cards can contain the following contents and variables; varying on each card some may present, some may not.
##### Cost / Benefit: 
Wether the player is paying or receiving crystals for activation of this card.
##### Instant Activation:
Some cards have a blitz-icon at the top right corner, colored with one of the eight emotion groups. If the player has an emotile saved in this color, this card has to be activated before all others, triggering also the saved emotion to be played onto a queue. 
##### Affected Axes:
Each event affects one of the axes by the event. The player uses one of the two axes matching his card with the board sectors to pick emotiles, leaving his marker on the used axis.
##### Element of Card:
The nature of the event is visible with an icon on the bottom-left corner and a matching border color for one of five elements; water, wood, fire, earth and metal. Beside the element icon is also a reference table for elemental conversions. Please also refer to Appendix 13.C for a detailed description and information on conversion.
##### Elemental Conversion:

Each card can be one of the five elemental phases, so their conversion possibilities are different. The reference table shows us how each element can be used as a reason to raise an emotion. 
The left side is used for targeting own queue, the right side for others' queue. 
The upper row for supporting and the lower for suppressing (or destroying) the outcome. 

The player might target a queue to support or suppress emotions.
By targeting own queue with the supporting cycle, the player recognizes arisen emotions or with suppressing, they might break patterns of emotions occurring. By targeting others queue, they gain understanding respecting their emotions. All of these have advantages, with the most favourable one as raising our Emotional Intelligence.

For a conversion, the player discards their selected card and picks an emotile from the bag with the targeted emotion and applies this onto a queue. On completing a checkmark, the same applies as applying them normally. 
##### Extra Action:
Additional bonus actions available after the cards gets played. 
##### Income (stress / tranquility):
Events manipulate our peace (counted with the peace track) by contributing as stress or tranquility, moving its marker to either side.
##### Event Details, title & text:
Thematic content describing the event which either results with or is the result of the played emotile.
