## Parents and Partners 
^d71eb6

Our life starts with our caregivers. We learn our first manners and interaction trough them. They also initiate and imprint our emotional blueprint, provide us with space and tools to develop our emotional background and tendencies.

We start with two caregiver personas as our parents. Throughout the game we are able to build relationships with other personas effecting our emotional sphere.

Personas bring in different behaviours; as each person has its own character, some of the caregivers come with their *traumatic issues*. Personas also have tendencies towards expressing various emotions, sometimes also have a *major emotion* they deal with. 
#### Major and Minor Emotions (a.k.a. Emotional Memory)

Both the major and regular emotions show the experienced emotions in relation with each persona. The combined 'emotional memory' of all interacted active personas show us our collective emotions.
