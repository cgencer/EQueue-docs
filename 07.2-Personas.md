## Parents and Partners 

We start our emotional experiences within our family and later extend it by building relationships, forming our inner circle. They initiate our social interactions, imprint us with expectations and motivations. While we create relationships in our social environment, these personas enable possibilities to experience different emotions. 

There are two types of persona cards: parents and partners. Parents can be distinguished by the motivations wheel below, which set our markers differently by begin of each game. They also have a major triggering emotion. The 'possible' partners have various interest-icons, which form a matching method for us to socialise.

The emotional narratives each one brings can be seen as a hindrance or a possibility to grow beyond. They consist of inherited patterns, tendencies, triggering emotions and emotional experiences (memories). Let's look at the global ones and also specific details regarding each persona type. 

- ### Emotional Patterns:

 Patterns are learned -inherited- emotional behaviours, dating mostly back to our childhood. Learned responses push us to act impulsively, resulting probably with undesirable results. While the familiarity puts us into comfort-zone, their cost is loosing bits of our awareness.
 
 Whenever a players queue establishes one of the emotional sequence shown on the personas bottom part, they'll loose all their colored crystals for this round. This means they will be unable to cover the costs of any events, so they will pass the play within this round.
 
 Patterns get triggered even when there are emotions in-between. As these patterns cast a shadow on our mindfulness, It is mandatory to dismantle them. 

- ### Emotional Memories:

Each persona interacts with us through different set of emotions, which are present on the persona cards. At the scoring phase at the end of the game, these act as fill-in emotions for counting completed sets of experienced emotions. 

- ### Major / Triggering Emotion:

One of those experienced memories is shown as a bigger slice, which is the major triggering emotion with that persona. The player might build a strategy to observe and even dismantle this. In doing so, player gains 5 clear crystals.
### Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
*set collection of recognised emotions*

Building sets of emotions enriches our EQ. A set can contain **recognised** emotions or  regularly experienced emotions trough personas. When different personas we are connected with have the same emotions more than once, these could be distributed among different sets when accounting. The player earns colorless crystals equal to the number of recognised emotions on completion of each set.
