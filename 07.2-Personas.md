Our life starts with our caregivers. We learn our first manners and interaction trough and with them. They also initiate and imprint our emotional blueprint, provide us with the basis to develop our emotional background and tendencies.

We start with two parents; throughout the game we are also able to build relationships with other personas affecting our emotional atmosphere.

Personas bring in different behaviours; as each person has its own character, some of the caregivers come with *issues*. Personas have tendencies towards expressing some emotions over others, sometimes also have a *major emotion* they deal with.

Persona cards can be distinguished as parents with the motivational wheel below and possible partners with the interest icons on the top right side.

Every persona we add to our inner circle has a different emotional narrative, they bring their motivations and act accordingly. These emotional baggages also become parts of us.
The Narrative Tiles each persona brings some personal missions, either we deal with these or become burdened by them. They contain inherited patterns, tendencies and emotional experiences (memories), some of these apply to parents only.

- ### (Inherited) Patterns:

 Patterns are learned emotional behaviours, our emotional strategies. The familiarity they create brings us advantages while loosing some awareness. Whenever our queue establishes a sequence matching the patterns of our parents we'll loose one of hardly earned clear crystals. As patterns cast a shadow on our mindfulness, It is mandatory to dismantle them.

- ### Emotional Memories:
	Both the major and regular emotions show the experienced emotions in relation with each persona.
	
- ##### Major / Triggering Emotion:
	It represents the most-occurring emotion of the personas narrative. 
	When using the layered emotions add-on this color is the entrance for dismantling layered emotions. 
- ##### Frequent Emotions:
	The combined 'emotional memory' on all personas emotional narratives show us various emotions experienced with the personas.
