Player **may** reserve one of the emotiles during their turn. Reserving a tile costs an additional crystal to the amount for card activation. Pay the total amount and put the tile onto the matching event-card, without carrying its actions / results. **Only** when attaching the tile to a queue will its result played out. The reserved tile enables double-placement for completing arising emotions. 
Only one emotile per player can be reserved within each round. On the end of the round all non-used and reserved tiles and their matching cards will be discarded.
