## Special Actions

#### Reserving and Using Reserved EmoTiles

Player **may** reserve the picked emotile on their turn. Reserving costs an additional crystal on top of cards costs. Pay the total amount and put the tile onto the matching event-card, without carrying its actions / results. **Only** when attaching the tile to a queue will their result played out. Reserved tiles enable double-placement for completing  emotions. 
Only one emotile per player can be reserved within each round. A reserved tile has to be played within the round. At the end of the round all non-used and reserved tiles with their event-cards have to be discarded.
###### *Double Placement of Tiles*
With a bit of planning players might be able to do a double placement of emotiles (with the event-card played in-between), resulting with express completion of an emotion.

#### Unbuilding Markers From Axes

As we progress and more event-cards got activated, the marker-spaces of the axes become occupied meaning that we'll have stronger motivations. Because these disturb our peace, players will strive to put markers back onto the shoshin track, where they came from.

#### Removing patterns

The elemental transformation through domination enables players to suppress and remove emotions from their queues. Each removal of an emotile on our queue which is part of a pattern lowers the potential of it re-occurring.

Each removal also brings us a peaceful state of mind, raising our tranquility. A removal of another players' queue brings +1 more tranquility, because we practice compassion.

#### Defining turn-order

Every round the turn order changes according to the number of clear crystals the players have accumulated, in **reverse order**. The player with the least crystals becomes first player and the one with the most becomes the last player. On a tie of crystal numbers the length of their queue decides; the shorter queue has precedence.

#### Transforming Actions into Emotions

The elements are aspects of nature that are continuously shifting and are associated with many aspects we could think of; emotions are but just one of these.

They are often described as stages of transformation and have a changing nature, not fixed. The shifting of emotions is similar to the shifting of the Elements.

Elements are connected to each other by various relations, nurturing or dominating in their behaviour. Each element -so their emotional results- can be either fed or fed by, can dominate or dominated by another element. This helps us to manipulate the outcome of events.

Every element is a representation of the phases in a closed cycle of behaviours. Emotions reflect these phases with their nature. 
###### The basic Emotions are associated with the elements:
1. **Fire** – Passion, love, rage
2. **Earth** – Worry, satisfaction, safety
3. **Metal** – Grief, letting go, courage
4. **Water** – Fear, peace, creativity
5. **Wood** – Anger, assertiveness, kindness

Water energy is forever-shifting and reminds us to expect change and movement on our journey – to go with the flow. 
Water’s emotion is fear and all the unknown diversions that could potentially carry us off course. 
The emotion associated with Wood energy is anger as a result of unrelieved stress. Because the nature of Wood is to expand, frustration sets in when growth is hindered, energy confined or progress slowed. 
Fire’s emotion is joy and the passionate, sometimes reckless, abandonment of rules. Over stimulation, anxiety and restlessness are also the consequences of Fire.
The emotion of Earth is melancholy and concern for all beings who need our protection. Boundaries are necessary to prevent obsession.
The emotion of Metal is grief and sadness for inability to reach perfection, hold on and to let go. Rigidity can rob us of the ability to yield, relax and forgive.

Transforming is the outcome of a supporting or dominating cycle of an action based on its elemental nature. As an example; we could support courage (of the element metal) to foster compassion (water element) or overcome anger (which is wood) through dominating. Courage (metal element) is fed by Equinimity (earth element). Here are the positive and negative emotional sides of each element in a supporting and dominating cycle listed:
