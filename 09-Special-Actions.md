## Special Actions
#### Reserving and Using Reserved EmoTiles

Player **may** reserve the picked emotile on their turn. Reserving costs an additional crystal  on top of card activation costs. Pay the total amount and put the tile onto the matching event-card, without carrying its actions / results. **Only** when attaching the tile to a queue will their result played out. The reserved tile enables double-placement for completing  emotions. 
Only one emotile per player can be reserved within each round. A reserved tile has to be played within the round. At the end of the round all non-used and reserved tiles with their event-cards have to be discarded.
#### Unbuilding Markers From Axes

As we progress and more event-cards got activated, the marker-spaces of the axes become crowded meaning that we'll have stronger motivations to fulfil. This works against our aim for The Middle Path as our needs and wants become our driving factors.
#### Removing patterns


#### Detaching emotions (from queues)

#### Converting crystals into blank crystals

#### Defining turn-order

Every round the turn order changes according to the number of clear crystals the players have gathered in **reverse order**. The player with the least crystals becomes first player and the one with the most becomes the last player. On a tie of crystal numbers the length of their queue decides in reverse order; the shorter queue has precedence.
