## Reserving Emotiles

Player **may** reserve one of the emotiles during their turn. Reserving a tile costs +1 crystal than its usual cost. Pay the whole amount and put the gathered tile onto the event-card, without carrying the cards benefits. Carry out its results **only** when attaching the tile to a queue. Only one emotile can be reserved within a round. Reserved but not used tiles and cards will be discarded on the end of the round.
#### Using the Reserved Tile

The reserved tile can be used during and before / after the players normal turn or they can be also played just after another players turn. This gives either a chance to attach twice or block a queue. Still the **emotional continuity rule apply** for using the reserved tile.
## Unbuilding Tendencies / Motivations (from axes)

We get dissatisfied of any situation because we always want just a bit more than the last time. We will have stronger needs and requirements each and every time we use these tendencies. Because of this raised expectations, we feel things stronger but we also won't get satisfied.

Playing the event-cards pushes our motivations on the eight axes to a higher level -outwards- bringing us further away from the middle. These raising expectations are the result of our previous events, the discs from the shoshin-track move to the axes marking their usage.

As we progress, we discover that giving way to more and more is not a solution for finding happiness. We should cut down our expectations in order to get satisfaction. To do this, we have to unbuild these motivators and raise our shoshin-level hopefully back to its initial state, at least to its minimal level.
