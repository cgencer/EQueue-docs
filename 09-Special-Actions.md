## Reserving EmoTiles
^dd5bad

Player **may** reserve one of the emotiles during their turn. Reserving a tile costs an additional crystal to the total amount for activation. Pay the total amount and put the tile onto the matching event-card, without carrying its actions / results. **Only** when attaching the tile to a queue will the action & result taken. One emotile per player can be reserved within each round. On the end of the round not used reserved tiles and their matching cards will be discarded.
#### Using the Reserved Tile

The reserved tile can be used during and before / after the players normal turn or they can be also played just after another players turn. This gives either a chance to attach twice or block a queue. Still the **emotional continuity rule apply** for using the reserved tile.
