## The Main Board

*usage of disc-markers, acquiring and replacing emotiles, removing disc-markers*

#### Sectors and Axes

The octagonal main board is built of eight sector tiles divided trough four axes of opposite themes, *The Eight Earthly Concerns*. Each sector has three levels with blank spaces for emotiles, connected with marker-spaces trough a network. When acquiring emotiles, a player has to leave a disc-marker of his color on the next available space of that axis.

#### Acquiring Emotiles

- Only the connected emotile to the to-be-occupied marker-space can be picked up. Each space has different connections shown with solid lines.
- Whenever an emotile is picked AND USED by attaching it to the end of a queue, a new one from the bag should be placed onto the emptied space. 
  When it is RESERVED (refer to [[09-Special-Actions#^dd5bad]]), the space remains empty until the time it is used.
- For placing markers, also follow the rules for marker placement on the next section:
#### Marker Placement on the Axes

The axes between the sectors represent different driving factors we start learning beginning with our earlier years. They work as motivating tendencies within life, our inner strategies of needs and requirements. These are also called **Eight Worldly Concerns** (refer to: [[13-Appendix#^b7d79b]]. 
- On playing an event-card we got accustomed to the listed *concern*, increasing our tendency towards it. Because of this, we remove a disc from the shoshin-track to put it onto an available marker-spaces.
- A player matches the axes of cards with the board to pick an emotile connected to the location they are able to place their marker on. 
- Placement is restricted to a decreasing number of players by level: 3 players on the first level, 2 on the second and only 1 on the last level are allowed to occupy with their markers.
- On any axis at any level, only one marker per player is allowed to be placed. If the maximum of a level exceeds with the new marker, the new marker has to be placed on the next level.
- Refer to the [[09-Special-Actions#^380cb8]] for removing markers from the axes.
