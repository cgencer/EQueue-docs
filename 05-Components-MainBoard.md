## Components and The Main Board
#### The Main Board
*usage of disc-markers, picking emotiles*

The octagonal board is built of eight sections divided with the four axes of opposite motivations. Each section has up to three locations for emotiles and are connected with the axes through the marker-spaces. Emotiles are picked up by moving a disc-shaped markers from players' shoshin-track onto the next available marker-space of an axis.

#### Picking Emotiles

- Each marker-space has various connections shown with the solid lines. Only (through these lines) connected emotile can be picked up following this procedure:
	- Choose an emotile to pick up,
	- Play a card matching one of the axes connected to the tile which is not occupied by own markers (or filled up),
	- Leave a marker onto the axis,
	- Take the emotile.
- Whenever an emotile is picked up it has to be applied to the end of a queue or held as reserve (if not done yet).
#### Marker Placement on the Axes

The axes between the sections represent various personal motivations or tendencies; *The Eight Worldly Concerns*. 
Motivations increase with the discs we place. Following rules apply to marker placement:
- Placement is restricted to a decreasing number of players by level (e.g. 3 players on 1st level (inner), 2 players on 2nd level and 1 player on the 3rd (outer) level are allowed).
- On any axis at any level, only one marker per player is allowed to occupy. 
- If the maximum of a space is reached, the marker has to be placed onto the next level and only the emotiles connected to the placed level are available. 
- If all spaces are occupied by the numbers they can hold, the axis won't be available to any player until markers fred.
