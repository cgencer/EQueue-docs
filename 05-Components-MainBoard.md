## The Main Board

*usage of disc-markers, acquiring and replacing emotiles, removing disc-markers*

![[wheel.JPG]]

The octagonal main board is built of eight sector tiles divided trough four axes of opposite themes, *The Eight Earthly Concerns*. Each sector has three levels with blank spaces for emotiles, connected with marker-spaces trough a network. When acquiring emotiles, a player has to leave a disc-marker of his colour on the next available space of that axis.

These rules apply to the usage of markers and acquiring emotiles:
- Each level has a maximum capacity for markers; 3 for the first (inner), 2 for the second and 1 for the last (outer) circle and these can not be exceeded anyhow.
- When an event-card is played, we got accustomed to the matched *concern* axis, increasing our tendency towards it. Because of this, we remove a disc from the shoshin-track to put onto empty marker-spaces.
- Each marker-space can be occupied by the same player once. If it is already occupied, the player should advance to the next available space on same the axis.
- Only the emotile connected to the filled marker-space with a line can be picked up.
- Whenever an emotile is taken AND USED by attaching it to the end of a queue, a new one from the bag should be placed onto the emptied space. When it is RESERVED, the space remains empty until the time it is used.
#### The Axes, [The Eight Earthly Concerns](https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Eight_worldly_concerns)

==Praise and blame, success and failure, 
pleasure and pain, and fame and disrepute;==
==these are the eight worldly conditions thatÂ revolve around the world and==
==the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.==

The axes are the source of emotions, four dualistic, mundane concerns that generally motivate our actions. These common denominators or major tendencies are the so-called *eight earthly concerns*, throwing us out-of-balance by triggering emotions.
- hope for pleasure / happiness & fear of pain / suffering,
- hope for gain & fear of loss,
- hope for praise & fear of blame,
- hope for good reputation / fame & fear of bad reputation / shame.
These are our innermost strategies to strive and survive. With some more insight, we could relate all of our emotions, decisions and actions to these motivations.  Preoccupation with these worldly concerns is said to be an important obstacle on our path.

- The motivations can be either the reason or result of emotions or events.
- Emotions can either be the reasons to or results of events.
- Events we experience within life can either be the reasons to or results.
