## The Main Board

*usage of disc-markers, acquiring and replacing emotiles, removing disc-markers*

#### Sectors and Axes

The octagonal main board is built of eight sectors divided with four axes of opposite motivations, *[[13-Appendix#^b7d79b|The Eight Earthly Concerns]]*. Each sector has three levels with blank spaces for emotiles, connected with marker-spaces trough a network of lines. When acquiring emotiles, players have to move one of their disc-markers from their shoshin-track onto the next available marker-space of an axis.

#### Acquiring Emotiles

- Each marker-space has different connections shown with solid lines. Only the emotile connected to the placed disc-marker can be picked up.
- Whenever an emotile is picked up it has to be applied to the end of a queue. 
- For reserving an emotile, refer to [[09-Special-Actions#^dd5bad||Reserving EmoTiles]].
- For placing markers, follow the rules for marker placement:
#### Marker Placement on the Axes

The axes between the sectors represent different driving factors. These are also called *The Eight Worldly Concerns*. 
Our tendencies increase with the event-cards played. The discs we place onto the axes mark our tendencies. They get removed from the shoshin-track in order to put it onto an available marker-spaces following these rules:
- The player matches specific axis of the event-card with the board to pick an emotile from the connected locations they are able to place their marker on. 
- Placement is restricted to a decreasing number of players by level. 3 players on the first level (inner), 2 on the second and only 1 on the last (outer) level are allowed to occupy with their markers.
- On any axis at any level, only one marker per player is allowed to occupy. If maximum is already reached, the new marker has to be placed onto the next level.
- Refer to the [[09-Special-Actions#^380cb8|Special Actions: Unbuilding Markers]] for removing markers from the axes.
