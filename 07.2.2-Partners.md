#### Interests and Matching with Partner

a- either LGBT+ friendly with 2 matches
b- or straight with 1 matches


Every player has various partner options. Within the round they encounter various personas, some do match their interests, some not so well suited.
To couple with one of the partners, the players character and any one of the available personas have to match interests by at least two icons. 
As the player is focused on the persona, they will end their turn by picking up the persona and this attention would cost them 2 crystals.
Player picks both the partner card and its accompanying narrative tile. 
The setup modifiers and patterns are discarded on the narrative tile for partners.

#### Matching Priorities

- ##### Player 1 - Elina:
There are no matching people for Elina. She needs to wait for the next turns for a potential.
- ##### Player 2 - Ben:
Ben is quite attractive and matches over their shared interest with all three females; cooking with Bianca, painting with Hanna and training with Clara. As Clara has the highest value, he befriends her but Isaac is also interested in her. Ben can easily choose Hanna or Clara to block Ben's interest. It's up to who takes the initiative and goes first.
- ##### Player 3 - Aria:
Becomes friends with Ben easily over their interest to meditation.
- ##### Player 4 - Isaac:
Isaac is the most social one in this circle; he became friends with Sean because of arts, chess and ballgames. He shares interest with Bianca for being fans of the same soccer team, plays chess with Finn, and rivals Ben because of Clara's chess interest.
