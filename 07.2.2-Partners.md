#### Matching with a Partner

During the game, every player gets various partner options. Within each round they encounter various personas, but only some match their interests.
To couple with one of the partners, the player and any of the available personas need to match interests by at least one interest-icon.
Because the new partner takes players attention, they pay with 2 crystals and end their turn. If there is a parent with emotional issues present, this partners card get tucked under the family, until the issues gets resolved.
Whenever a partner is picked up, a new partner will be added to the emptied space.

##### Example of Matching Priorities

- ###### Player 1 - Elina:
There are no matching people for Elina. She needs to wait for the next turns for a potential.
- ###### Player 2 - Ben:
Ben is quite attractive and matches over their shared interest with all three females; cooking with Bianca, painting with Hanna and training with Clara. As Clara has the highest value, he befriends her but Isaac is also interested in 
her. Ben can easily choose Hanna or Clara to block Ben's interest. It's up to who takes the initiative and goes first.
- ###### Player 3 - Aria:
Becomes friends with Ben easily over their interest to meditation.
- ###### Player 4 - Isaac:
Isaac is the most social one in this circle; he became friends with Sean because of arts, chess and ballgames. He shares interest with Bianca for being fans of the same soccer team, plays chess with Finn, and rivals Ben because of Clara's chess interest.
