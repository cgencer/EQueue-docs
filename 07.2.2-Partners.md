## Partners
![[partners.png]]

*The female partner has music, writing, theatre and travelling as their interests and the male partner has biking, writing, music and theatre as interests. These two have 3 matching interests, which makes them more than interesting to each other. Both have green as their major emotion (refer to [[06-Tiles^]]).* 
#### Interests and Matching with Partner

Every player has various partner options. Within the round they encounter various personas, some do match their interests, some not so well suited.
To couple with one of the partners, the players character and any one of the available personas have to match interests by at least two icons. 
As the player is focused on the persona, they will end their turn by picking up the persona and this attention would cost them 2 crystals.
Player picks both the partner card and its accompanying narrative tile. 
The setup modifiers and patterns are discarded on the narrative tile for partners.
