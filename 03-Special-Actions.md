## Reserving Emotiles

Player may reserve one of the emotiles during their turn. Reserving a tile costs +1 crystal than its usual cost. Pay the whole amount and put the tile onto the event-card, without carrying the cards benefits. Carry out its results **only** when attaching the tile to a queue. Only one emotile can be reserved within a round. Reserved but not used tiles and cards will be discarded on the end of the round.
## Using the Reserved Emotile

The reserved emotile can be used during and before / after the players normal turn or they can be also played just after another players turn. This gives either a chance to attach twice or block a queue. Still the **continuity-rules apply** for using the reserved tile.
