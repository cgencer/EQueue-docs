## Emotion Tiles, a.ka Emotiles

*emotional chaining, continuity of emotion*

The emotiles are double-sided five-coloured tiles with stripes which are attached to the end of other players queues. They are gathered from the octagonal board, The Eight Earthly Concerns.

***A Single Emotile:** the dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellow and in the center light green.*

The colours represent the basic emotional groups (anger, disgust, interest, joy, sadness, surprise, fear, trust). The specific emotions have no importance within this game. [Robert Plutchik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik "en:Robert Plutchik")'s [Wheel of Emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_classification#Plutchik's_wheel_of_emotions "en:Emotion classification" is an overview of most well-known emotions and their colors ()) is a good reference for classificaton and colour representation of the emotions.

When tiles are attached one-by-one, consecutive placement of the tiles creates a continuity of a colour troughout tiles, representing the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion, from outermost level *(seed)* to the second-level *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third-level *(becoming)*, form a visual checkmark facing either left or right (the side has no meaning). 

Whilst on the first- and second-level it is possible to spend some awareness for observing *(dismantling a pattern)* it. On the last level, on becoming, it is already risen and can't be undone. Placement of the emotiles should follow the continuity of colours and tiles with no continuity shouldn't be placed.

***Fulfilled emotion:** The first emotile, the dormant colour of yellow *(seed)* moves into the second level *(evolving)* on the next tile and on the next emotile, it comes into existence *(becoming)*. The red on the 1st and 2nd tiles don't have a seed emotion. With the next emotile, a blue in the middle could fulfil another emotion.*

## EmoTile Placement Examples

![[placements.png]]
1. Not any colours are continuing, placement of the second tile is NOT allowed.
2. There is no middle-stage of orage, thus it is NOT allowed to place the second tile.
3. Second tile should'nt be placed, as there is no continuity between the two. The third tile has both yellow and lila progressing, the second tile has no connections with the first, this queue is problematic, second tile shouldn't been attached.
4. Both the yellow and blue colours work, but no begin-stage is available. They were allowed to play but with none fulfilled checkmarks are present. 
5. The yellow checkmark is well advanced and completed.
6. Two checkmarks have been completed: yellow (at the first tiles) and red (last three tiles). The green progression on 4th & 5th tiles are okay, as they were a side-result of the yellow checkmark.
7. Red and yellow checkmarks at right side and progressing blue on the last tiles on left-side. But only the completed checkmarks are considered as fulfilled.
## Heritage Tiles

*inheritance of emotions, tendencies on concern-axes*

When we could observe all our emotions moment by moment within our daily lives, we would see that we experience some recurring sequences. These differ for each person. They are learned behaviours and reflexive responses, mostly rooting back to our family environment, childhood events as well as our daily lives. To master any sports or performing music, we would exercising repetitive actions until they become reflexes. This also happens for emotions, when we practice them regularly they become autonomous responses, resulting with some degree of loss on awareness each time. Because of this process of learning they decrease our shoshin-state.

Every player can have one or more pattern-tiles, showing a sequence of emotions, a pattern. These are inherited and learned sequence of emotions stemming from our closed social circle: the family we grow in and later our relationships. Fulfilling these patterns has the advantage of varied abilities but with the cost of loosing mindfulness.
