## Emotion Tiles, a.k.a. Emotiles

*emotional chaining, continuity of emotion*

The emotiles are double-sided tiles with five coloured stripes. They are picked up from the main board to be attached to the end of a players queue or held on at the players reserve.

***A Single Emotile:** the dormant emotions blue and light green, followed by its second-level orange and yellowÂ and in the center light green.*

Even though they bear no importance within the game, the colours represent the basic emotional groups (anger, disgust, interest, joy, sadness, surprise, fear, trust). More info is available at [Appendix 13.1, The Colors of Emotions](13.1-The-Colors-of-Emotions).

When tiles are attached one-by-one, consecutive placement of the tiles creates a continuity of a colour-stripe troughout a few tiles. This represents the growing of an emotion: a dormant emotion gets nurtured and grows into existence. The rising emotion, from outermost level *(seed)* to the second-level *(evolving)* and lastly to the middle third-level *(becoming)*, form a visual checkmark facing either left or right. Their side bears no meaning. 

Whilst on the first- and second-level it is possible to spend some crystals for being aware of its growth. On the last level, on becoming, it is already risen and can't be suppressed. Placement of the emotiles should follow the continuity of colours and tiles with no continuity shouldn't be placed. New tiles should be placed where the arrow points to, at the queue's end.

**A fulfilled emotion:** The first emotile, the dormant colour of yellow *(seed)* moves into the second level *(evolving)* on the next tile and it comes into existence *(becoming)* on the third. The red on the 1st and 2nd tiles don't have a seed emotion. With the next emotile, a blue in the middle could fulfil another emotion.

## EmoTile Placement Examples

![[placements.png]]
1. Not any colours are continuing, placement of the second tile is NOT allowed.
2. There is no middle-stage of orage, thus it is NOT allowed to place the second tile.
3. Second tile shouldn't be placed, as there is no continuity between the two. The third tile has both yellow and lila progressing, the second tile has no connections with the first, this queue is problematic, second tile shouldn't been attached.
4. Both the yellow and blue colours work, but no begin-stage is available. They were allowed to play but with none fulfilled checkmarks are present. 
5. The yellow checkmark is well advanced and completed.
6. Two checkmarks have been completed: yellow (at the first tiles) and red (last three tiles). The green progression on 4th & 5th tiles are okay, as they were a side-result of the yellow checkmark.
7. Red and yellow checkmarks at right side and progressing blue on the last tiles on left-side. But only the completed checkmarks are considered as fulfilled.
## Inheritance Tiles 
##### ([[13-Appendix#^005365]])

With every every persona we interact, we also get an inheritance tile. These act as our in-game missions, emotion patterns (sequences), tendencies and major triggering and usual emotions with its cost and benefits.

There will be two types of inheritance tiles; Parents and Partners. The later having less features as the former. Take care to take tiles accordingly.
